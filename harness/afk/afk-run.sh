# up that isolation by accident.

#
# Posture (safe by default):
#   - RALPH_IMAGE       = ralph-sandbox-harness  (the harness sandbox image;
#                         an existing RALPH_IMAGE override is honored — that is
#                         the break-glass digest pin
#   - RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK = 0                       (no host docker socket mount)
#
# Mounting the host docker socket hands the sandbox root-equivalent control of
# this machine's Docker daemon. So a non-zero RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK is REFUSED
# unless the caller passes --i-know — an informed opt-out, with the blast radius
# printed, not a silent default.
#
# The loop only ever commits. It never pushes, opens a PR, or ships — that
# boundary is the in-loop stage gate plus a human reviewing the diff before any
# merge. This launcher does not change that.

# --- loop-controller exit-code contract (must match afk_termination.py) ------
# The native loop controller speaks a small exit vocabulary. The launcher reacts
# to three codes that are NOT plain failures and must not be lumped under a
# generic "exit >= 2 == abort":
#   3  RESTART_REQUESTED — a sentinel asked for a fresh loop; the launcher honors
#      it by re-invoking, bounded by AFK_MAX_RESTARTS so a stuck restart loop
#      cannot run forever.
#   42 AWAITING_USER     — a human-handoff PAUSE, not a fatal abort. The loop
#      stopped cleanly to wait for an operator decision; the launcher hands off
#      and propagates 42 rather than erroring out.
# Everything else keeps the prior contract: 0/1 are clean/budget finishes, any
# other >= 2 is a genuine guard trip / error worth aborting on.

# file asks for a fresh loop; dropping the stop file ends the loop cleanly. Kept

# --- run: probe with one iteration, then the remaining N-1 -------------------

# a wedged image) there is no point burning the rest of the budget.
# Native-loop mode: the harness drives the iteration loop itself via the loop
# controller, run INSIDE the sandbox image so isolation is preserved — a host-side
# run would bypass the container boundary. No host docker socket is mounted here
# regardless of RALPH_DOCKER_SOCK. Default stays on Ralph until the native image
# path is validated against a live image.
#
# Probe-abort threshold differs by mode. Ralph: any non-zero exit is a failed
# probe. Native loop controller: exit 1 means a HEALTHY run hit its iteration
# budget (a one-iteration probe always exhausts at N=1), which is NOT a failure —
# only exit >= 2 signals a genuine guard trip or error worth aborting on. So the
# native probe tolerates exit 1 and aborts only at exit >= 2.
