"""loop_controller.py — the native AFK iteration driver.

The harness drives each AFK iteration directly instead of delegating the loop to
Ralph: invoke Claude → capture stdout → parse the AFK_STATUS block → feed the
guards → continue or stop with a named Termination. The invoker is INJECTED, so
the loop logic is fully unit-testable without a live Claude (the way ralph-cc
covers its loop with fakes); `make_claude_invoker` is the thin live seam.

Per-iteration order:
  1. restart sentinel present → RESTART_REQUESTED (exit 3, supervisor re-invokes)
  2. stop sentinel present    → EXPLICIT_STOP (exit 0)
  3. invoke(iteration, session_id)
  4. is_error → drop the session id (never resume a broken context)
  5. parse status; record fingerprint → STALE_LOOP if the same call repeats N×
  6. circuit breaker update → CIRCUIT_OPEN on stagnation/permission wall
  7. dual-condition exit gate → EXIT_SIGNAL_CONFIRMED
  loop exhausted → MAX_ITERATIONS.
