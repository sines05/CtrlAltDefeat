## Usage Notes

- Pick ONE skill per distinct user intent
- If a task spans two domains (e.g. "build + deploy"), suggest the primary skill and mention the secondary
- Domain skills combine with core workflow: `/hs:plan` → domain skill → `/hs:cook`
- Skills not listed here are either core workflow skills (see `skill-workflow-routing.md`) or utility skills activated on demand (e.g. `/hs:ask`, `/hs:preview`, `/hs:sequential-thinking`)
