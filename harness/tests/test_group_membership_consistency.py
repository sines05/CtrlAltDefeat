"""Group->skills membership must not drift across its sources.

Post-collapse the same themed grouping is recorded in two files that serve
different roles: decomposition-map.yaml (skill->group, the forward-split map) and
components.yaml (group->skills, the install-time label index read by
skill_selection). They agree today, but nothing else enforces it — moving a skill
in one file alone would silently diverge the installer from the migrator. This
invariant cross-asserts the two for every themed group.
