"""Shared test scaffolding for the spec-graph / fence / memory-gap suites.

Plain helpers (NOT fixtures) so call semantics stay identical to the source
suite this scaffolding mirrors. The valid-spec fixture tree is built
PROGRAMMATICALLY into a temp dir at import instead of being committed as
files: the repo only carries markdown under plans/ and docs/, so test data
lives in code and materializes per run.

  - ``VALID``     — the read-only valid-spec tree every ``make_proj`` copies.
  - ``make_proj`` — writable copy of the fixture, optional git-init baseline.
  - ``append_to`` — append a line to a docs/product artifact.

# The dev who configured THIS repo runs with HARNESS_* posture overrides exported
# (terminal voice / guard / stage / agent-permissions point at dev files, injected
# via the .claude/settings.json `env` block). Those must NOT bleed into the suite:
# every test asserts SHIPPED-default behavior unless it sets its own override via
# monkeypatch. Scrub posture pointers once per test so a configured dev session
# and a clean CI run see identical defaults. Mirrors the pre-push hook's HARNESS_*
# scrub — posture input is the tracked/default file, never the ambient env. A test
# that needs an override re-sets it with monkeypatch (runs after this autouse
# fixture, so it wins).
#
# The keep-set is the PLUMBING allowlist (identity + state/log placement seeds
# tests set themselves), mirroring session_init._BASELINE_ENV. Everything else
# under HARNESS_* is posture and is scrubbed. Allowlisting (not a fixed posture
# list) is staleness-proof: a new posture knob — e.g. HARNESS_AGENT_PERMISSIONS_-
# OVERLAY — is scrubbed automatically, so a configured dev shell never re-reds the
# suite each time a knob is added.

# a skill's SKILL.md / references/ path as DATA (those run + assert fine, and

# Vision — Acme Shop

## Problem Narrative

Boutique fashion brands sell through marketplaces that take 30%+ and bury
them under competitors. Their fans want to support them directly but have no
easy path. Acme Shop closes that gap.

## Value Proposition

For boutique brands, this is the only storefront that lets them keep 95% of
revenue and message fans directly.
