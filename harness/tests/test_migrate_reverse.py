"""Reverse-migration tests — the inverse of the forward decomposition split.

The reverse engine collapses every themed sibling plugin (hs-<g>) back into the
spine plugin (hs): it moves each skill dir hs-<g>/skills/<s> -> hs/skills/<s> and
rewrites every reference hs-<g>:<s> -> hs:<s> (and the path form). Together with the
forward split it must be a true identity round-trip for all 84 non-spine skills.

Everything below runs against a temp-dir fixture (plugin dirs + text files); the
real repo tree is never touched. Post-collapse the live tree holds only the single
`hs` plugin -- no `hs-<g>` siblings survive -- so even the full 84-count assertion
builds a SYNTHETIC 14-plugin themed tree (the authoritative pre-collapse topology,
reconstructed from the canonical group maps) and inverts that.
