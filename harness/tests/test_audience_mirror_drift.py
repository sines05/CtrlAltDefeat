"""test_audience_mirror_drift.py — drift test ensuring the report-rendering
pointer is wired identically into all 13 report skills AND 8 report agents.

Modelled after test_handoff_deps_drift.py — count-coupling is intentional. The
contract lives in harness/rules/output-rendering.md; each of the 21 files carries
a one-line pointer. This test asserts content-consistency of that pointer (the
canonical tokens), not mere presence of the word "audience".
