"""ci.sh is the single source of CI job names + commands for every CI face.

These tests pin the remote-tier job set by a HARDCODED expectation rather than by
reading ci.sh back: dropping a job from ci.sh must red this test, not silently shrink
remote coverage while a consistency-only parity check stays green. The dispatcher is
driven through a real `bash` subprocess, never imported.
