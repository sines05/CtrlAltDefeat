"""test_inject_prompt_context_slim.py — the slim-refresh channel.

The context re-injection hook re-states the load-bearing rules on a decay-aware
cadence. Emitting the full ~2.3K-token block on EVERY refresh re-pays for rules
that were already loaded once this session; the model only needs the full block
the first time the window turns over. This suite covers the slim channel: the
first injection after a SessionStart stays full, later refreshes emit a compact
~slim block, and a config toggle (inject_refresh_mode: full) restores the old
behaviour verbatim for A/B + rollback.

Two seams, same as the sibling suite: subprocess for the real stdin/stdout +
state-file contract, in-process for the pure builders.
