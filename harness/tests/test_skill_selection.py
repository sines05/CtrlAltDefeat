"""Install-time per-skill selection (collapse to one hs plugin).

After the collapse every skill lives under harness/plugins/hs/skills. There is no
per-plugin toggle left, so a fresh install picks skills at the dir level: a group
expands to its skills, deps auto-tick, and the spine core is always present. The
deselected skills are OMITTED at copy — the only disable that works for plugin
skills on this CC (disable-model-invocation is unsupported, per the mode-A probe).
