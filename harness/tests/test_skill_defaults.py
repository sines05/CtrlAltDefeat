"""Lock the shipped default-off skill catalog (skill-defaults.yaml).

A fresh install ships ~38 skills ON and 71 OFF (copied to the stash, reachable via
the hs:use proxy). This SSOT is hand-edited YAML; these tests pin the invariants the
list must never silently drift from: it may never hide a floor or an interview-kept
skill, every name must be a real skill, the count is fixed, and the onboarding
clusters must partition the OFF set exactly.
