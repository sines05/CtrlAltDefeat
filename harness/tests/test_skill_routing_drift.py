"""Drift guard for the static routing rules.

Two prose routing tables live in `harness/rules/`:
  - `skill-domain-routing.md`   — domain decision-tree (domain -> skill)
  - `skill-workflow-routing.md` — intent-phrase -> start-command table

Both name skills as `/hs:<skill>` routes. This guard parses every skill
reference out of the two tables and asserts each one is a REAL skill in
`skill-deps.yaml`. If a table names a skill that is renamed or removed from the
graph, the table has drifted and this test goes red.

Scope note (KISS, by design): the lens only checks that a referenced
skill-NAME still exists. It deliberately does NOT diff each table row against
that skill's `description`/`when_to_use` word-for-word — semantic drift of the
prose is out of scope (no NLP-diff over-engineering). Name-existence catches
the structural drift D13 worried about; that is enough.
