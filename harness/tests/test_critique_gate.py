"""test_critique_gate.py — critique-consensus artifact gate policy.

The critique skill in gate mode writes a machine-readable verdict to
plans/<active>/artifacts/critique-consensus.json. Its verdict policy mirrors
review-decision: a hard stage passes ONLY on verdict exactly PASS —
PASS_WITH_RISK is a conscious soft-accept, BLOCKED means stop.

Enforcement is decoupled into stage-policy and SHIPS OFF: the default
harness/data/stage-policy.yaml lists critique-consensus at NO stage, so a fresh
(spine-only) install is never surprise-blocked by an artifact whose producer
(hs:critique) is an opt-in plugin. Turning it on is a tracked one-line
stage-policy edit; the per-mechanism unit tests below opt in via a temp policy
(HARNESS_STAGE_POLICY). The default posture is locked by
TestShippedPolicyDoesNotDefaultGateCritique. This is a PRESENCE gate — it proves
the critique ran, not who ran it.
