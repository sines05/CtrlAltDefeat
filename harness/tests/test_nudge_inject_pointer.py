"""test_nudge_inject_pointer.py — per-session observation pointer for the
nudge-inject re-surfacer.

The re-surfacer re-reads the audit trace at each UserPromptSubmit to find this
session's newest turn-end observation. The old code, on a tail-miss in the
current-day file, paid a FULL read of the whole (multi-week, multi-MB) file — 5+
times per prompt (once per observation family plus each relayed name). This
module replaces that with a per-session pointer: a small cache holding, per
family, the newest observation record already seen plus the byte offset scanned
up to. The next prompt seeks that offset and scans only the NEW bytes; a cache
hit supplies an observation that has since fallen out of the bounded tail window,
so the full read is never needed.

Contract under test:
  - busy day (obs out of the tail window) is served from the pointer cache with
    ZERO full-file read.
  - a newer observation appended after the pointer still supersedes it.
  - a missing/corrupt pointer degrades to the bounded tail (fail-open), never a
    full read and never a raise.
  - the single-shot-per-kind marker is unchanged: an already-surfaced obs is not
    re-injected.
