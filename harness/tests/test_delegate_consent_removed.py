"""Absence contract for the removed advisory-delegate consent mechanism.

Test-first for a REMOVAL: these assertions define what must be gone once the
gate is torn out (core files, hook registration, skill embeds, config row,
ghost comments in the kept explore guards). Red while the mechanism is still
present; green after Phase 2 removes it.

Reads the repo tree directly (no import of any delegate module — they are
being deleted), so gated behind dev_repo: an installed copy ships none of
these artifacts and the absence is trivially satisfied there.
