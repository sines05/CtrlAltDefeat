"""Tests for harness skill cross-reference and workflow-chain validator.

Covers:
- Valid refs resolve without error
- Broken refs (/hs-x:ghost) are detected
- Orphan skills (no inbound / outbound edges) are detected
- Present chain edges pass; missing ones are reported
- Code-fence refs are excluded
- Self-references are ignored
- Both /hs:<skill> and /hs-<group>:<skill> namespaces match
