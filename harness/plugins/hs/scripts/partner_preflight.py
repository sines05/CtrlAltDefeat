"""partner_preflight.py — read-only ccs discovery + a gate honest about what it
finds. `ccs api list` prints a human ANSI table (verified against a live run)
— never parsed.

Provider names are resolved from ccs's OWN config, not guessed: the unified
`<ccs-home>/config.yaml` carries a `profiles:` map whose keys are exactly the
names a `ccs <name>` call resolves — so every real profile is discovered and
none is dropped by a hardcoded exclusion (shared/local are legitimate profiles
on setups that define them, not meta-junk). Only the profile KEYS are read;
the config's other blocks and any settings file's contents (which carry
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN) are never read or emitted. When the unified config is
absent (older ccs), discovery falls back to globbing `*.settings.json`
basenames. The ccs home is resolved (HARNESS_CCS_HOME > ~/.ccs), not a fixed
literal. This module NEVER mutates ccs config and NEVER auto-installs ccs.
