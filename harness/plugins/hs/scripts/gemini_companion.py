"""gemini_companion.py — the ONE chokepoint every gemini call passes through.

`partner_call(purpose, prompt, ...)` is the single place that (1) reads the lane
config, (2) refuses when master=off (inert, no spawn), (3) resolves the model for
the purpose (override wins, else the purpose tier — never a hardcoded id, RT-12),
(4) WARNS on secrets in the prompt (D7 v1: warn-only, never mask/block), (5)
stamps provenance (engine+model) on every outcome (D6), (6) drives the ACP client,
and (7) degrades LOUDLY + stamped on a down gemini — NEVER a silent Claude
fallback (S4/RT-07). Verbs (P4) and the worktree-staging write path (P5) append to
this module; keeping one chokepoint is what makes the P8 drift-test meaningful.

Path discipline: the config loader lives in harness/scripts and resolve_actor in
harness/hooks; both are added to sys.path off __file__ (never CWD), since this
module is imported from an installed .claude/ tree too.
