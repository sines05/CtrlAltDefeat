"""partner_companion.py — the ONE chokepoint every ccs partner-lane call
passes through. Twin of gemini_companion.py's partner_call, but
SINGLE-engine BY CONSTRUCTION: ccs itself proxies to whichever
provider profile the caller names, so there is no cross-engine fallback here
— provider picks the destination, never a hardcoded lane, and a down ccs
degrades LOUD rather than silently falling back to a second engine or to
main Claude.

`partner_call(purpose, prompt, provider, ...)` is the single place that:
  1. reads the lane policy (`master: off` -> Inert, no spawn);
  2. validates the provider against LIVE discovery before ever spawning —
     never call ccs blind;
  3. composes the purpose's methodology preamble
     (partner-prompt-templates.yaml, miss -> raw prompt);
  4. WARNS (never blocks) on a secret-looking COMPOSED payload — see the
     HONESTY note below;
  5. drives CcsPrintTransport with retry-on-transient (single lane, no
     cross-engine fallback);
  6. stamps provenance with a `ccs:`-prefixed reviewer_engine so a finding
     never blurs with the gemini lane (`reviewer_engine: gemini`) or main
     Claude;
  7. compares cost to `cost_warn_usd` and stamps/warns when exceeded;
  8. degrades LOUDLY + stamped on a down transport — NEVER a silent
     main-Claude fallback.

HONESTY (verified live via red-team review): the secret-scan at step 4 sees
ONLY the composed prompt STRING. The delegated full-Claude that
`ccs <provider> -p ...` spawns can itself Read files off disk (.env,
~/.ccs/* tokens) and egress them without ever passing this scan — this is a
PROMPT-LEVEL warn, not an egress boundary. `egress_scope:
"whole-repo-readable"` is stamped on every outcome so the provenance trace
never claims otherwise; real containment (env-scrub) is a future concern,
NOT this scan — never market this scan as egress protection.

Path discipline: partner_config/partner_preflight live in harness/scripts and
resolve_actor in harness/hooks; both are added to sys.path off __file__
(never CWD), since this module is imported from an installed .claude/ tree
too (mirrors gemini_companion.py).
