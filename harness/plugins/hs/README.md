# hs

SDLC harness — one hs: plugin holding the full skill catalog (spine SDLC loop hs:plan/cook/test/ship/fix/debug/code-review/review-pr/git/scout/understand/setup/triage plus opt-in groups flow/think/research/create/mem/meta and the domain ports ai/devops/stack/uiux/integrations/extra/viz). Groups are install-time logical labels; skills are selected per-skill at install.

**Default:** always-on (the SDLC spine — installed and enabled on every harness).
**Version:** 5.1.0

## Packaging notes

This plugin is **repo-embedded by design**, not marketplace-cache portable: its skills/agents assume the full harness tree at `harness/` (scripts, data, rules) under the project root, and its 17 fail-closed gate hooks are wired per-project in `.claude/settings.json` rather than in a plugin-level `hooks/hooks.json` — a deliberate two-zone choice that keeps gate policy out of a user-scope manifest an agent could otherwise widen via a project-local write (the F3 hole). It still installs cleanly in global mode (one shared `$HARNESS_BIN_ROOT` binary, many projects); it just is not copy-into-`~/.claude/plugins/cache/` portable today. See `plans/260709-1514-cc-docs-standardization/artifacts/investigation/INV-2-plugin-self-containment.md` for the full trade-off.

`workflows/*.js` (`ping`, `base-fanout-consolidate`, `base-pipeline-verify`) uses Claude Code's plugin-bundled workflow loading (`<plugin>/workflows/*.js` namespaced `hs:`). This loading path is not yet listed in CC's official file-locations table (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/workflows) — treat it as an undocumented-but-observed convention. The `scriptPath` fallback documented in `harness/rules/orchestration-protocol.md` stays mandatory as the hedge if the convention ever changes.
