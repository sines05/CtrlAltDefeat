# hs:plans-kanban — file-based plan kanban board

Reads the YAML frontmatter `status` from every `plans/<ts>-<slug>/plan.md` and renders a kanban board directly in the CLI. No server or browser required.

**Cross-ref**: use `hs:project-management` when you need to update status, sync tasks, or generate detailed reports — `hs:plans-kanban` is read-only navigation, it does not write.

## Modes / arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| (empty) | Show full board: 3 columns, all plans |
| `--active` | Only the `in-progress` + `approved` columns (reviewed-and-ready counts as active work) |
| `--done` | Only the `completed` column |
| `--plan <slug>` | Show detail for one plan: title, phases, % done |
| `--filter <tag>` | Filter by tag in frontmatter `tags:` |

## Workflow

1. **Scan** — `find plans/ -name "plan.md" -not -path "*/reports/*"` (exclude `plans/reports/` and `plans/templates/`).
2. **Parse frontmatter** — read the `---...---` YAML block at the top of each file; extract: `title`, `status`, `priority`, `tags`, `created`, `branch`.
3. **Normalize then group by status**. First fold variants the way the schema does — strip quotes, replace `-` with `_`, and fold the RETIRED labels `draft`/`awaiting_human_approval` to `pending` (their canonical home). Compare the folded value against the canonical set (`harness/scripts/plan_status.py:CANONICAL_STATUSES` = `pending, approved, in_progress, completed, cancelled`):

   | Column | Canonical status |
   |---|---|
   | TODO | `pending` (a legacy `draft`/`awaiting_human_approval` folds here) |
   | APPROVED | `approved` (reviewed, not yet cooked) |
   | IN PROGRESS | `in_progress` |
   | DONE | `completed` |
   | (hidden) | `cancelled` — render only under `--filter` |
   | ⚠ DRIFT | any value that is not canonical after folding (e.g. `done`, `implemented`, or a missing field) |

   A DRIFT plan is shown in its own row, NOT silently dropped into the board, and the warning names `harness/scripts/reconcile_plan_status.py` as the fix. A retired `draft`/`awaiting_human_approval` label folds to TODO for display, but `reconcile --fix` migrates it for real (evidence-aware: an APPROVED artifact lifts it to `approved`).

4. **Render board** — print a 4-column table TODO · APPROVED · IN PROGRESS · DONE (markdown table or compact list depending on width), one row per plan: `priority | slug | title | branch | created`.
5. **Navigate** — print the absolute path to `plan.md` for every plan that is IN PROGRESS; prompt the user to open it or invoke `hs:project-management status`.
6. **Warn** — a plan missing frontmatter or `status` → warn clearly with the file name; do not crash the board.

## Boundaries

- **READ-ONLY** — do not modify any file in `plans/`.
- Do not create markdown outside `plans/` or `docs/` (CLAUDE.md rule #5 — not applicable here because this skill does not create files).
- Do not write tasks, mark done, or sync — that is the responsibility of `hs:project-management`.
- Source of truth for status is the local `plan.md` file, not a remote task provider (`harness/scripts/task_store.py` is advisory-only for task tracking).
- End with: board printed + list of absolute paths for active plans.

## Actual backing (wiring)

This skill reads files — it has no dedicated hard gate. However:
- `plans/*/plan.md` YAML frontmatter `status` is the sole data source.
- `harness/hooks/gate_stage.py` still blocks the `push|pr|ship|deploy` stage independently of this skill — the kanban view does not bypass the gate.
- To update status: use `hs:project-management sync` and then re-run `hs:plans-kanban` to see the updated board.
