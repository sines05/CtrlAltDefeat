# Shopify Development

Build Shopify apps, extensions, themes, and API integrations with current Shopify CLI workflows and GraphQL-first Admin API guidance.

## Platform Overview

**Core Components:**
- **Shopify CLI** - Official app, extension, and theme workflow tool
- **GraphQL Admin API** - Default API for new app data operations
- **REST Admin API** - Legacy/migration-only for new development
- **Polaris UI** - Merchant-facing design system
- **Liquid** - Theme template language

New public apps created after 2025-04-01 must use the GraphQL Admin API. Use REST only for legacy maintenance or migration work.

**Extension Points:**
- Checkout UI - Customize checkout and thank-you surfaces
- Admin UI - Extend admin resource pages
- POS UI - Point of Sale customization
- Customer Account - Account and order status pages
- Theme App Extensions - Embedded storefront functionality
- Shopify Functions - Discount, delivery, payment, and validation logic


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest
shopify version
```

### App Workflow

```bash
# Create an app from official Shopify templates
shopify app init
cd my-app

# Link/select the app configuration used by this checkout
shopify app config link
shopify app config use

# Start local development against the selected config/store
shopify app dev

# Generate an extension (interactive picker selects the type)
shopify app generate extension

# Release Shopify-managed app config and extensions
shopify app deploy
```

`shopify app deploy` deploys Shopify-managed app configuration and extensions. Deploy your hosted web app/server separately on your hosting platform.

### Theme Workflow

```bash
shopify theme init
shopify theme dev
shopify theme pull --live
shopify theme push --development
```


## Workflow & Patterns

Development workflow (CLI scaffolding, dev/deploy cycle), essential implementation patterns, and troubleshooting: [`workflow-and-patterns.md`](references/workflow-and-patterns.md).

## When to Build What

### Build an App When
- Integrating external services
- Managing store data programmatically
- Building merchant-facing admin tools
