# hs:goal — author a built-in /goal run, then step aside

Built-in `/goal` sets a string objective and self-iterates until a Stop-hook reports "met". It resets context every tick and never fires `UserPromptSubmit` mid-loop, so rules/voice are not re-injected and each tick forgets the last one. `hs:goal` does NOT fix that by reimplementing the loop (impossible — it is built-in). It prepares the run so the loop can work from FILES instead of memory,
then hands off.

Authoring boundary (do not cross): `hs:goal` generates a **NEW** self-contained `goal.md` and arms the substrate — see Boundaries below for the full rule.

Full detail: `references/authoring-protocol.md`. The intra-run breadcrumb convention the loop reads/writes each tick: `references/cycle-convention.md`.

## Three START actions, then hand off

1. **Interview → generate a NEW `goal.md`.** Ask for the objective, the acceptance signal ("met" means what, concretely), and the scope fence. Write a self-contained `goal.md` (objective + a pointer to `harness/rules/` + explicit acceptance) because the loop is rules-blind mid-run — everything the run needs must live in that file. Do not edit an existing `goal.md`; author a fresh one.

2. **Arm `hs:autonomous-bell`** with a **run tag** (the cron id / goal run id). The bell is the deterministic stop substrate; its backlog query is scoped to that tag. Backlog items added during the run carry `source_ref: <run-tag>` so the bell's run-scoped query (`autonomy_bell.py --backlog-signal --source-ref
   <run-tag>`) sees only THIS run's open work — never a global open item.

3. **Scaffold the cycle dir.** The built-in host writes `goal.md` to `goals/<goal_name>/goal.md` (relative to the launch cwd). Put the cycle memory in that SAME dir: `goals/<goal_name>/cycle_N.md`, beside the host's `goal.md`, so each tick can drop a breadcrumb (## Done / ## Next / ## Blocker /
   ## Decisions) the next tick reads. The whole `goals/` tree is gitignored and
   ephemeral per-run — never commit it. Shape + protocol: `references/cycle-convention.md`.

Then **hand the loop to built-in `/goal iterate-until-met`** and stop. `hs:goal` owns no iteration code; the built-in engine drives the loop, the bell decides when to stop, the cycle breadcrumbs carry memory across ticks.

## Boundaries

- Do NOT reimplement the `/goal` iteration engine — it is built-in, not editable.
- Do NOT edit an existing `goal.md` (ephemeral per-run, never a durable target). Always author a NEW one.
- Cycle-memory is intra-run only (the goal dir is ephemeral) — not cross-run.
- This is for UNATTENDED runs; interactively the operator is the stop signal.
- Shared autonomous safety posture (loop/afk/goal group):
  `../loop/references/safety-guardrails.md` — bake the relevant rules into the generated goal.md (atomic commit, verify-or-rollback, no push/ship in-loop).
