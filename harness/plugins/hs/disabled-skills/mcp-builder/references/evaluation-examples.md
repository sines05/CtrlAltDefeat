# MCP Server Evaluation — Examples & Verification

Companion to `./evaluation.md` (the design guide) and `./evaluation-running.md` (the runner).

## Evaluation Examples

### Good Questions

**Example 1: Multi-hop question requiring deep exploration (GitHub MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Find the repository that was archived in Q3 2023 and had previously been the most forked project in the organization. What was the primary programming language used in that repository?</question>
   <answer>Python</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Requires multiple searches to find archived repositories
- Needs to identify which had the most forks before archival
- Requires examining repository details for the language
- Answer is a simple, verifiable value
- Based on historical (closed) data that won't change

**Example 2: Requires understanding context without keyword matching (Project Management MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Locate the initiative focused on improving customer onboarding that was completed in late 2023. The project lead created a retrospective document after completion. What was the lead's role title at that time?</question>
   <answer>Product Manager</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Doesn't use specific project name ("initiative focused on improving customer onboarding")
- Requires finding completed projects from specific timeframe
- Needs to identify the project lead and their role
- Requires understanding context from retrospective documents
- Answer is human-readable and stable
- Based on completed work (won't change)

**Example 3: Complex aggregation requiring multiple steps (Issue Tracker MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Among all bugs reported in January 2024 that were marked as critical priority, which assignee resolved the highest percentage of their assigned bugs within 48 hours? Provide the assignee's username.</question>
   <answer>alex_eng</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Requires filtering bugs by date, priority, and status
- Needs to group by assignee and calculate resolution rates
- Requires understanding timestamps to determine 48-hour windows
- Tests pagination (potentially many bugs to process)
- Answer is a single username
- Based on historical data from specific time period

**Example 4: Requires synthesis across multiple data types (CRM MCP)**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Find the account that upgraded from the Starter to Enterprise plan in Q4 2023 and had the highest annual contract value. What industry does this account operate in?</question>
   <answer>Healthcare</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is good because:
- Requires understanding subscription tier changes
- Needs to identify upgrade events in specific timeframe
- Requires comparing contract values
- Must access account industry information
- Answer is simple and verifiable
- Based on completed historical transactions

### Poor Questions

**Example 1: Answer changes over time**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>How many open issues are currently assigned to the engineering team?</question>
   <answer>47</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is poor because:
- The answer will change as issues are created, closed, or reassigned
- Not based on stable/stationary data
- Relies on "current state" which is dynamic

**Example 2: Too easy with keyword search**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>Find the pull request with title "Add authentication feature" and tell me who created it.</question>
   <answer>developer123</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is poor because:
- Can be solved with a straightforward keyword search for exact title
- Doesn't require deep exploration or understanding
- No synthesis or analysis needed

**Example 3: Ambiguous answer format**
```xml
<qa_pair>
   <question>List all the repositories that have Python as their primary language.</question>
   <answer>repo1, repo2, repo3, data-pipeline, ml-tools</answer>
</qa_pair>
```

This question is poor because:
- Answer is a list that could be returned in any order
- Difficult to verify with direct string comparison
- LLM might format differently (JSON array, comma-separated, newline-separated)
- Better to ask for a specific aggregate (count) or superlative (most stars)

## Verification Process

After creating evaluations:

1. **Examine the XML file** to understand the schema
2. **Load each task instruction** and in parallel using the MCP server and tools, identify the correct answer by attempting to solve the task YOURSELF
3. **Flag any operations** that require WRITE or DESTRUCTIVE operations
4. **Accumulate all CORRECT answers** and replace any incorrect answers in the document
5. **Remove any `<qa_pair>`** that require WRITE or DESTRUCTIVE operations

Remember to parallelize solving tasks to avoid running out of context, then accumulate all answers and make changes to the file at the end.

## Tips for Creating Quality Evaluations

1. **Think Hard and Plan Ahead** before generating tasks
2. **Parallelize Where Opportunity Arises** to speed up the process and manage context
3. **Focus on Realistic Use Cases** that humans would actually want to accomplish
4. **Create Challenging Questions** that test the limits of the MCP server's capabilities
5. **Ensure Stability** by using historical data and closed concepts
6. **Verify Answers** by solving the questions yourself using the MCP server tools
7. **Iterate and Refine** based on what you learn during the process
