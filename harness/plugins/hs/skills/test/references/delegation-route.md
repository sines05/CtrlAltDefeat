# Delegation + verdict-route (on-demand)

How hs:test delegates the suite run and how the main thread routes on the verdict. Loaded when hs:test delegates instead of running the suite inline.

## `@tester` = run + report ONLY

Delegate the suite run to a `@tester` subagent to keep the (often large) test output out of the main context — the main win. The `@tester`:

- runs the resolved test command + reports a verdict: PASS / PASS_WITH_RISK / BLOCKED;
- lists `checks[]` and the **Unmapped** list — code files with no covering test;
- **does not write tests.** It runs and reports only.

The no-write constraint is a **prose posture**, not a lane in this repo: the shipped table gives `@tester` the `plans/**` lane (no `harness/tests/**`), but this dev repo's overlay grants `**`, so here the guard is the prose carved into `agents/tester.md`, not the RBAC lane. `@tester` also must NOT re-spawn `@tester` / `/hs:test` (it runs the suite inline via Bash) — that avoids a spawn loop.

`--in-place` runs the suite straight at main (opt-out), skipping the delegation.

## Verdict-route threshold (DoD-anchored + counting fallback)

The main thread reads the `@tester` verdict + Unmapped list and routes:

| Gap size | Signal | Route |
|---|---|---|
| **LARGE** | a `test_type` that `test-policy.yaml` REQUIRES for the diff's change-class is missing (a DoD FAIL — `test_policy.evaluate_test_policy`) | `@developer` writes the test **test-first** (the TDD cadence at cook/@developer) — do not patch it hastily at main |
| **LARGE (fallback)** | ≥2 code files unmapped (no covering test), when no test-policy type is explicitly required | `@developer` writes the missing tests |
| **SMALL** | only a coverage nicety (no required DoD type absent), or <2 unmapped files | main fixes inline |

The metric is **DoD-anchored first, a raw unmapped count as the fallback** — a missing required test-type is a hard gap that owes a real test, a coverage nicety is not.
