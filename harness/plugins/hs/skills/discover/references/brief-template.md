## Checklist before marking "finalized"

- [ ] Problem framing clear: who, what, why
- [ ] Hard constraints fully listed
- [ ] Evidence summary has report link (or [SKIPPED])
- [ ] Option space has >=2 directions (except --quick single-option)
- [ ] Chosen direction has rationale, not just an empty preference
- [ ] Open questions listed — do not pretend everything is known
- [ ] OUT of scope clearly stated — prevents scope creep into planning
