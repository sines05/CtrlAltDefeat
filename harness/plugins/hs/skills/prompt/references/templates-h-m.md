## Template H — ReAct + Stop Conditions

*Claude Code, Devin, AutoGPT, any AI that takes autonomous actions. Runaway loops and scope explosion are the biggest credit killers in agentic workflows — stop conditions are not optional.*

```
Objective:
[Single, unambiguous goal in one sentence]

Starting State:
[Current file structure / codebase state / environment]

Target State:
[What should exist when the agent is done]

Allowed Actions:
- [Specific action the agent may take]
- Install only packages listed in [requirements.txt / package.json]

Forbidden Actions:
- Do NOT modify files outside [directory/scope]
- Do NOT run the dev server or deploy
- Do NOT push to git
- Do NOT delete files without showing a diff first
- Do NOT make architecture decisions without human approval

Stop Conditions:
Pause and ask for human review when:
- A file would be permanently deleted
- A new external service or API needs to be integrated
- Two valid implementation paths exist and the choice affects architecture
- An error cannot be resolved in 2 attempts
- The task requires changes outside the stated scope

Checkpoints:
After each major step, output: ✅ [what was completed]
At the end, output a full summary of every file changed.
```

## Template I — Visual Descriptor

*Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Sora, Runway, any image or video generation tool.*

```
Subject: [Main subject — specific, not vague]
Action/Pose: [What the subject is doing]
Setting: [Where the scene takes place]
Style: [photorealistic / cinematic / anime / oil painting / vector / etc.]
Mood: [dramatic / serene / eerie / joyful / etc.]
Lighting: [golden hour / studio / neon / overcast / candlelight / etc.]
Color Palette: [dominant colors or named palette]
Composition: [wide shot / close-up / aerial / Dutch angle / etc.]
Aspect Ratio: [16:9 / 1:1 / 9:16 / 4:3]
Negative Prompts: [blurry, watermark, extra fingers, distortion, low quality]
Style Reference: [artist / film / aesthetic reference if applicable]
```

**Tool-specific syntax:**
- **Midjourney**: comma-separated descriptors, not prose. Add `--ar`, `--style`, `--v 6` at the end.
- **Stable Diffusion**: `(word:1.3)` weight syntax. CFG scale 7–12. Negative prompt is mandatory.
- **DALL-E 3**: prose works well. Add "do not include any text in the image" unless text is needed.
- **Sora / video**: add camera movement (slow dolly, static shot, crane up), duration in seconds, cut style.

## Template J — Reference Image Editing

*When the user has an existing image to modify. Completely different from generation — never describe the whole scene from scratch, only describe the change.*

**Before writing the prompt, always tell the user:** "Attach your reference image to [tool name] before sending this prompt."

**Detect the tool's editing capability:**
- Midjourney: `--cref [image URL]` for character reference or `--sref` for style reference.
- DALL-E 3: use the Edit endpoint, not Generate. User must be in ChatGPT with image editing enabled.
- Stable Diffusion: use img2img mode, not txt2img. Denoising strength 0.3–0.6 to preserve the original.

```
Reference image: [attached / URL]
What to keep exactly the same: [list everything that must not change]
What to change: [specific edit only — be precise]
How much to change: [subtle / moderate / significant]
Style consistency: maintain the exact style, lighting, and mood of the reference
Negative prompt: [what to avoid introducing]
```

**Example:**
```
Reference image: [attached portrait photo]
What to keep exactly the same: face, hair, clothing, background, lighting
What to change: head angle — rotate from facing left to facing straight forward
How much to change: subtle, preserve all facial features exactly
Style consistency: maintain photorealistic style, same lighting direction
Negative prompt: no new elements, no style changes, no background changes
```

## Template K — ComfyUI

*ComfyUI node-based workflows. Always output Positive and Negative prompts as separate blocks. Ask for the checkpoint model before writing — syntax and token limits differ per model.*

**Ask first if not stated:** "Which checkpoint model are you using? (SD 1.5, SDXL, Flux, or other)"

**Model-specific notes:**
- SD 1.5: shorter prompts work better, under 75 tokens per block, use `(word:weight)` syntax.
- SDXL: handles longer prompts, supports more natural language alongside weighted syntax.
- Flux: natural language works well, less reliance on weighted syntax, very responsive to style descriptions.

```
POSITIVE PROMPT:
[subject], [style], [mood], [lighting], [composition], [quality boosters: highly detailed, sharp focus, 8k]

NEGATIVE PROMPT:
[what to exclude: blurry, low quality, watermark, extra limbs, bad anatomy, distorted, oversaturated]

CHECKPOINT: [model name]
SAMPLER: Euler a (recommended starting point)
CFG SCALE: 7 (increase for stricter prompt adherence)
STEPS: 20-30
RESOLUTION: [width x height — must be divisible by 64]
```

## Template L — Prompt Decompiler

*When the user pastes an existing prompt and wants to break it down, adapt it for a different tool, simplify it, or understand its structure. Analysis and adaptation, not building from scratch. This is `--fix` mode.*

**Detect which Decompiler task is needed:**
- **Break down** — explain what each part of the prompt does.
- **Adapt** — rewrite for a different tool while preserving intent.
- **Simplify** — remove redundancy and tighten without losing meaning.
- **Split** — divide a complex one-shot prompt into a cleaner sequence.

**For Adapt tasks, always ask:** "What tool is the original prompt from, and what tool are you adapting it for?"

**Break down output format:**
```
Original prompt: [paste]

Structure analysis:
- Role/Identity: [what role is assigned and why]
- Task: [what action is being requested]
- Constraints: [what limits are set]
- Format: [what output shape is expected]
- Weaknesses: [what is missing or could cause wrong output]

Recommended fix: [rewritten version with gaps filled]
```

**Adapt output format:**
```
Original ([source tool]): [original prompt]

Adapted for [target tool]:
[rewritten prompt using target tool syntax and best practices]

Key changes made:
- [change 1 and why]
- [change 2 and why]
```

**Split output format:**
```
Original prompt: [paste]

This prompt is doing [N] things. Split into [N] sequential prompts:

Prompt 1 — [what it handles]:
[prompt block]

Prompt 2 — [what it handles]:
[prompt block]

Run these in order. Each output feeds the next.
```

## Template M — Opus 4.7 / 4.8 Task Brief

*Any complex, multi-step, or agentic task on Claude Opus 4.7 or 4.8 (current default) — claude.ai, API, or Claude Code. Both read prompts literally and produce narrow output when context is missing. Front-loads everything so the first turn is the only turn.*

```
## Objective
[What needs to be built, fixed, or produced — one clear sentence. Add WHY if it affects approach.]

## Context
[What exists now — relevant files, current behavior, stack already in place, what was tried and failed]

## Target State
[What done looks like — specific files changed, behavior produced, tests passing. Binary where possible.]

## Scope
- Work only in: [specific files and directories]
- Do NOT touch: [forbidden files — .env, package-lock.json, configs, anything outside scope]

## Constraints
- [Stack version, naming conventions, no new dependencies without asking]
- Only make changes directly requested. Do not add features, abstractions, or files beyond what was asked.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Binary check 1]
- [ ] [Binary check 2]
- [ ] [Binary check 3]

## Stop Conditions
Stop and ask before:
- Deleting any file
- Adding any dependency
- Modifying database schema or migrations
- Touching anything outside Scope

## Progress
After each completed step: ✅ [what was done] — [file(s) affected]
```

**Thinking depth** — add only when needed, delete otherwise:
- Hard multi-step task: `"Think carefully and step-by-step before starting."`
- Simple targeted change: `"Prioritize responding quickly. This is a scoped change."`
- Default: say nothing — adaptive thinking calibrates itself.

**Claude Code only — add a Session Strategy block when relevant:**
```
## Session Strategy
[Pick one:]
- New session — unrelated to prior context, start fresh
- Continue — prior context still needed
- Subagent — spin off for [file-heavy research / verification] so intermediate output stays out of main context
- Compact first — run /compact [focus on X] then begin
```

**When to use:** Opus 4.7 or 4.8 on any surface when the task is complex, multi-file, ambiguous, or agentic. Not needed for simple one-shot tasks.
