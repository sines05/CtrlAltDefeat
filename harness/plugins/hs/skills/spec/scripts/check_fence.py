"""
check_fence — advisory soft-fence SCAN. Reports working-tree changes that land
OUTSIDE `docs/product/`. ADVISORY ONLY: it never blocks, always exits 0, and is
not a write guard.

This is the pull-side companion to `fs_guard` (the script-path write guard).
Where `fs_guard` refuses an out-of-tree SCRIPT write, this scan surfaces — after
the fact — any file the session touched outside the spec boundary (including raw
LLM `Write`s and LLM-composed bodies that the guard cannot intercept). It feeds
the behavioral pass as a soft nudge, not a gate.

Mechanism: `git status --porcelain` over the project root, listing every changed
path; any path not under `docs/product/` is one `fence_breach` finding (severity
`warn`). No LLM, deterministic. If `root` is not inside a git work tree, the scan
degrades to empty findings (it cannot read change state, and advisory is not an
error).

CLI:
    check_fence.py --root <project-dir>
