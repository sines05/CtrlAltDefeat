render_html — thin orchestrator for self-contained HTML visualization pages.

Reads:
  - assets/templates/visual-html-shell.html (the page skeleton)
  - assets/vendor/mermaid.min.js (vendored Mermaid; pin via install.sh)

If the vendored mermaid.min.js is missing, the renderer falls back to a
CDN-hosted script tag and prints a visible warning banner in the output.

Output is one self-contained file at:
  docs/product/visuals/<view>-<timestamp>.html

CLI usage is via visualize.py.

Structure:
  render_html_risk_grid.py    — HTML-native risk grid (3×3 impact × likelihood table)
  render_html_assets.py       — vendor/asset loaders + body-render helpers
  render_html_count_grid.py   — HTML-native count grids (status heatmap, persona coverage)
  render_html_competition.py  — HTML-native competition view (parity matrix + threat heatmap)
  render_html_tooltip.py      — hover-tooltip island + client scanner
  render_html_governance.py   — HTML-native multi-dim dashboard
  render_html.py              — this orchestrator: escaping, view-body dispatch, page assembly
