"""
check_consistency_schema — goal + frontmatter schema-shape checks. No judgment.

Focused sibling of check_consistency (mirrors check_consistency_time / _risk /
_competition): the rules that police artifact/goal SHAPE against the frontmatter spec,
kept out of the main module so it stays lean.

Emits:
- goal_without_metric   (error)  goal with no success metric at all
- legacy_metric_key     (warn)   goal still on the old singular `metric:` → run migrate
- goal_without_status   (warn|error)  goal missing required status; error once the BRD
                                 declares schema_version >= 2 (a migrated/fresh spec is
                                 fully gated; a not-yet-migrated legacy spec only warns)
- unknown_goal_key      (warn)   a stray goal key outside the spec's allowed set
- misplaced_parent_field(warn)   a story carrying prd/brd_goals (its parent is the epic)
- bad_version_format    (warn)   a `version` that is not semver-lite (major.minor.patch)

Pure functions over the already-built graph; the caller (check_consistency) folds these
into its findings list.
