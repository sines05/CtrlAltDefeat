"""dec_ledger.py — per-workspace DEC ledger allocator for hs:spec.

Ledger file: ``<root>/docs/product/decisions.md`` — a hand-maintained markdown
file, one ``---``-fenced YAML frontmatter block (id/status/date/actor/ts/affects)
per DEC, followed by a ``## DEC-<n>`` heading and prose. Append-only: prior bytes
are never rewritten, only appended to.

Allocation rule: new id = max existing id + 1, where the existing ids are EVERY
``DEC-<n>`` token found anywhere in the ledger text (a heading, a frontmatter
``id:``, or even a body reference). This widest-possible scan is deliberate: a
collision only comes from UNDER-counting the max, so no heading style a hand
edit might use (indented, tab-prefixed, setext, comment-wrapped, italic
``_DEC-<n>_``, or an id carried only in frontmatter) can hide a live id.
``max + 1`` is strictly greater than every existing id, so a fresh allocation
can NEVER collide — a pre-existing hand-edit duplicate does not block a new
``--add`` (the old whole-ledger uniq gate bricked every future alloc on a corrupt
ledger). The only cost is that a body quoting a DEC number ABOVE the current max
nudges the counter to a gap; ``_render_block`` defuses tool-written title/body
tokens so that only happens on a hand edit, and gaps are allowed. Gaps are NOT filled.

Race-safety: the whole critical section {read max -> allocate -> append} runs
under an exclusive ``fcntl.flock`` held on a sibling
``<root>/docs/product/.decisions.lock`` file (created if absent). flock is
advisory POSIX and only serializes cooperating callers on the same machine —
see references/dec-ledger.md for the Linux-only assumption this rests on.

This module is scoped to the per-workspace *product* ledger only. It does
**not** import or call the harness's own architecture register script (see
references/dec-ledger.md for its file name), and does **not** use that
script's atomic-allocation CLI flag: that allocator is built for a
tool-managed YAML SSOT and double-allocates when pointed at a hand-maintained
markdown ledger (the exact bug this module exists to avoid — see
references/dec-ledger.md for the two-ledger split).

# counted in full, so the max is never undercounted into a live-id collision.
