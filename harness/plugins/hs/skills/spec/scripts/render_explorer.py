"""
render_explorer — `--viz explorer` html writer. One self-contained page with
an in-page mode toggle across three layouts that share search + facet filters:

  • Tree       — collapsible <details> nav + click → sanitized body (default mode)
  • Flat-tabs  — one tab per layer type + pane
  • Table-tree — treegrid: depth-indented rows, metadata columns, expand → body

Security mirrors render_board: the server emits an inert JSON island; the client
builds metadata via safe DOM APIs and bodies via the sanitize chokepoint. No
Mermaid (a --format mermaid request falls back to the ascii tree).
