time_realism_anchors — SCRIPT half of the `time_realism` LLM check (TIME dimension).

`time_realism` is an LLM-judgment warn (Script-vs-LLM split) — "this deadline
is unrealistic for this scope" is a sensory call no regex can make. But to stop the
LLM hallucinating ("phi thực tế" is the classic over-flag), the design pins the
LLM to STRUCTURED, SCRIPT-precomputed anchors and forbids it from doing any date math:

    {artifact_id, file, type, size, horizon, target_date, today_date,
     days_remaining, child_story_count, incomplete, eligible}

`days_remaining = (target_date - today).days` is computed HERE, not by the LLM. The
LLM only applies the fixed AND-rule against these numbers (see the scaffold in
references/validation-rules-spec.md → "time_realism LLM scaffold").

`today_date` comes from a pinnable `--today <ISO>` (default = real today). Evals/tests
PIN it so the anchor — and therefore the gate's reproducibility — is deterministic
(no wall-clock value in the output). This is the SAME pinning contract as time_advisory.py.

This script emits ONLY anchors — it never decides flag/no-flag (that is the LLM's
judgment). An epic missing any anchor needed by the rule (no `target_date`, or no
`size`) is emitted with that field null and `eligible: false` so the LLM returns
`{finding: null, reason: "missing_anchor"}` without inventing data.

Scope: epics (the size+story-count unit the rule is defined on). A PRD has
no `size` and is not the realism unit, so it is skipped.

Pure data assembly — no LLM, no judgment, no wall-clock side effects beyond the
pinnable today. Always exits 0 (an advisory feeder, never a gate); a malformed
--today is the one user error worth a non-zero exit.

CLI:
    time_realism_anchors.py --root <project-dir> [--today YYYY-MM-DD]
        Prints {schema_version, root, today, checked_at, anchors:[...]} to stdout.
        Exits 0. (`checked_at` is wall-clock provenance, same envelope as the
        validate findings schema; the deterministic payload is `anchors`.)
