competitive_drift_anchors — SCRIPT half of the `competitive_drift` LLM check
(COMPETITION dimension).

`competitive_drift` is an LLM-judgment warn (Script-vs-LLM split) — "this
PRD is losing its competitive edge" is a sensory call no enum-match can make. But
to stop the LLM hallucinating ("mất lợi thế" is the classic over-flag), the design
pins the LLM to STRUCTURED, SCRIPT-precomputed anchors and
forbids it from inventing a competitor or a parity verdict:

    {artifact_id, file, type, scope,
     competitive_parity:[{competitor_id, competitor:<resolved name>, parity}],
     competitors_with_data, all_behind_competitors, incomplete, eligible}

The script RESOLVES the PRD's ID-keyed `competitive_parity` map against the BRD's
DRY competitor identity home (`graph['competitors']`) into NAME-bearing rows, and
pre-computes `competitors_with_data` (the count of parity entries whose value is
NOT `none`) — the LLM does NO counting and never re-parses brd.md. The LLM
only applies the fixed AND-rule against these numbers (see the scaffold in
references/validation-rules-spec.md → "competitive_drift LLM Scaffold").

The anchored rule: a PRD is flag-ELIGIBLE only when it is
`scope: core-value` AND has `competitors_with_data >= 2` real parity verdicts. The
LLM then flags only if EVERY resolved, real (non-`none`) parity is `behind` —
which the script also pre-lists as `all_behind_competitors`. Anything short of
that (`scope != core-value`, < 2 verdicts, or any non-`behind` among them) → the
LLM returns `{finding: null}`. Conservative default: uncertain → do NOT flag.

This script emits ONLY anchors — it never decides flag/no-flag (that is the LLM's
judgment). A PRD that cannot meet the rule (wrong scope, < 2 data points) is still
emitted with `eligible: false` so the LLM returns `{finding: null}` without
inventing data — the explicit anti-hallucination case.

Scope: PRDs (the unit that carries BOTH `scope` and `competitive_parity`).
Epics/stories have no parity map and are skipped. A parity KEY that does
not resolve to a BRD competitor is dropped from the resolved block (the structural
`unknown_ref` error is the consistency check's job, NOT this feeder's) so the LLM
never sees a phantom competitor.

Pure data assembly — no LLM, no judgment, no wall-clock side effects. Always
exits 0 (an advisory feeder, never a gate), mirroring time_realism_anchors.py.

CLI:
    competitive_drift_anchors.py --root <project-dir>
        Prints {schema_version, root, checked_at, anchors:[...]} to stdout. Exits 0.
        (`checked_at` is wall-clock provenance, same envelope as the validate
        findings schema; the deterministic payload is `anchors`.)
