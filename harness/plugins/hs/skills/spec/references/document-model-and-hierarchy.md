# Document Model & Hierarchy

The artifact roles, the DRY "one home per fact" rule, and the BRD(1) ↔ PRD(many) relationship. This is the **content-ownership** contract that prevents drift between PRD narrative and story decomposition.

- **Vision** (`vision.md`) — strategic narrative; 1-3 year direction; personas; value prop; north-star metric.
- **PRODUCT.md** — *thin* labels-only context file; the DRY home for product facts.
- **BRD** (`brd.md`) — **one BRD per product**; business goals + metrics + stakeholders + constraints + market.
- **PRD** (`prds/<slug>.md`) — **one PRD per feature-area**; many per BRD. Each PRD links to ≥1 BRD goal.
- **Epic** (`epics/<id>.md`) — decomposes a PRD into shipping-sized chunks; carries business context.
- **Story** (`stories/<id>.md`) — single user-facing slice; carries AC.

## What Lives Where vs Not

**PRD owns:** narrative, scope (in/out), NFRs, success metrics → BRD goals, personas (labels), MoSCoW list of functional requirements, dependencies, open questions.

**PRD does NOT own:** story AC. PRD does NOT enumerate every story — that's the epic/story layer.

**Story owns:** As-a/I-want/so-that statement, AC list, size, persona labels.

**Story does NOT own:** business rationale (that's the epic), feature-level scope (that's the PRD), or product-wide context (that's PRODUCT.md/vision).

**Epic owns:** epic goal, links to (1) the PRD functional requirement it implements and (2) the BRD goal it advances, success criteria for the epic, risks specific to the epic.

## BRD(1) ↔ PRD(many)

One BRD per product. Many PRDs per BRD. The PRD lists which BRD goals it advances (via `brd_goals: [BRD-G1, BRD-G3]`). One BRD goal can be addressed by multiple PRDs — that's expected. Validation flags BRD goals with **zero** PRDs as `orphan_brd_goal` (warn — structural; sufficiency is a separate LLM judgment).

## Impact-Pass vs Catalog (don't conflate)

Two distinct ways "what's affected" is computed — keep them separate:

- **Impact-pass** — the per-CHANGE propagation surface that was *designed* to run on `--validate`
  and `--update`, but **is not shipped in this build**: no script or workflow step wires it into a
  report, and `--update` is not a flag `hs:spec` exposes (see `validation-rules-spec.md → Impact-Pass
  LLM Scaffold` and `workflow-validate-judgment-cache.md` for the full caveat). As designed, it
  would run `spec_graph.downstream(<changed-id>)` over the **live** graph for the IDs that actually
  changed (snapshot-delta), then layer a one-line LLM annotation (`dim_touched · one_liner · action`)
  per affected node and flag it for PO review — dynamic (depends on *what changed*), partially
  LLM-graded, never auto-rewriting prose. It would report to `docs/product/impact/<ts>.md` and append
  to an `affected_set:` change-log field, but neither file is written by anything today.
- **Catalog** — a *static* enumeration of the whole spec: every node/edge as it exists right now, independent of any
  change. The traceability matrix, the `tree`/`explorer` views, and the snapshot JSON are catalogs. Deterministic,
  no LLM, no notion of "what changed".

Rule of thumb: a **catalog** answers "what exists?"; the **impact-pass** answers "given THIS change, what now needs a
look?". The graph (`spec_graph.py`) is the single source for both, but only the impact-pass consumes the snapshot delta.

## DRY Rule — Why It Matters

If a fact moves (e.g., the core-value sentence is rephrased in PRODUCT.md), every artifact that depends on it should be **flagged for review** (delta-update). The skill does NOT auto-rewrite prose; the PO decides which downstream nodes to refresh.

If a fact is duplicated (e.g., a persona definition copied into vision.md AND a PRD), validation flags it as `duplicate_fact` (LLM judgment, not structural). Default: warn; the PO chooses to consolidate.

## Vision vs PRODUCT.md — Why Both

- **`vision.md`** = narrative, prose, the *story* of the product.
- **`PRODUCT.md`** = labels, one-liners, the *facts* of the product.

The split exists because:
1. **Vision is long-form** and read once by humans; **PRODUCT.md is short-form** and read every interview cycle by the skill (to skip already-answered questions).
2. **Vision changes slowly**; PRODUCT.md changes per release (current implementation, deployment state, roadmap one-liner).
3. The interview adaptivity rule "**skip questions already answered by PRODUCT.md**" needs a compact lookup file.

If the product is tiny, PRODUCT.md may be the only file; vision.md becomes optional. Default = both.

## Status Lifecycle

```
draft → review → approved
            ↑        │
            └────────┘  (re-edit after change)
```

- `draft` — being authored or edited. Default for new artifacts.
- `review` — sent for stakeholder review (no behavior change in the skill; just a flag).
- `approved` — set by editing frontmatter directly (a scripted `--approve` flow that would also add
  the `approval:` block was designed but is not shipped in this build — see
  `frontmatter-and-id-spec.md`'s Approval Block caveat). Contradictions are surfaced, not auto-flipped.

The skill never auto-flips `approved` → `draft`. A contradiction is surfaced and the PO chooses keep / change / hybrid (see CLAUDE.md "No silent reversals").

## Cross-Artifact References

References are always by **ID** (frontmatter), never by file path or by prose. Examples:

- `PRD-AUTH.brd_goals: [BRD-G1]` — PRD references BRD goal.
- `PRD-AUTH-E1.prd: PRD-AUTH` — epic references PRD.
- `PRD-AUTH-E1-S1.epic: PRD-AUTH-E1` — story references epic.

Prose may *mention* IDs (`"This story addresses BRD-G1..."`) but those are advisory; the script graph only follows frontmatter.

## When the Hierarchy Bends

Some products won't have all five levels:

| Product size | Hierarchy |
|--------------|-----------|
| Tiny solo project | `PRODUCT.md` + a few stories. |
| Single-feature MVP | `PRODUCT.md` + vision + 1 PRD + stories (skip BRD if no business goals are formal). |
| Standard | full hierarchy. |
| Multi-team | full hierarchy; multiple PRDs per BRD goal. |

The skill never requires upper layers — if BRD is skipped, PRDs simply have an empty `brd_goals` list (validation warns once, then accepts). Default flow encourages the full hierarchy, but supports gradual fill-in.
