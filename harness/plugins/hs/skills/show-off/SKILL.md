Activate `hs:frontend-design` to create a showcase HTML presentation for the following request.

## REQUEST / MISSION
$ARGUMENTS

## PURPOSE
Showcase, social-media posting, and optional output images for articles.

## Persisted Preferences (MANDATORY — resolve BEFORE project-management)

`show-off` has user-level workflow preferences. Defaults preserve legacy behavior:

```json
{ "screenshots": true, "publishing": true, "languages": ["vi", "en"] }
```

Resolve them before reading the mission content:

```bash
PREF_SCRIPT="${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}/harness/plugins/hs/skills/show-off/scripts/preferences.js"
node "$PREF_SCRIPT" get
```

The helper stores preferences at `~/.claude/show-off/preferences.json` (override with `SHOW_OFF_PREFS_PATH`). Full CLI: `references/capture-and-preferences.md`.

Parse only workflow-control intent before project-management:
- Screenshots: "no screenshots" / `--no-screenshots`.
- Publishing: "no publish" / "local only" / `--no-publish`.
- Language: "English only" / "Vietnamese only" / `--languages en`.
- Reset: "reset show-off preferences". One-time: "for this run only" → apply without persisting.

If the user changes a setting and does not say it is only for this run, persist it immediately (`node "$PREF_SCRIPT" set ...`). The latest explicit instruction wins over stored preferences; do not ask the user to repeat a persisted opt-out.

## Prerequisite (MANDATORY — run BEFORE content workflow)

After resolving preferences, invoke `/hs:project-management` **before** any content work — it owns the plan/task lifecycle; `show-off` is a consumer. It must:
- Create a dated plan dir under `plans/` (`{date}-{issue}-{slug}` from hook injection).
- Register the checklist as tasks: always request-analysis, content, HTML, local review; add capture if `screenshots=true`; add publish if `publishing=true`.
- Set the active plan context so `frontend-design`, the capture script, and assets share one folder.
- Record invocation args + resolved preferences in `plan.md`.

Hard gate: do NOT proceed until the plan dir exists and the checklist is registered. If `project-management` returns `BLOCKED` / `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, resolve it first.

## Detailed Instructions

Follow strictly in order; update the registered tasks as each step starts/completes:

1. Read and analyze the request; split into 2–6 topics/sections (including a hero section).
2. Search the internet for supporting evidence / fact-checking.
3. Write content markdown at `assets/showoff/<mission-name>/content.md`, organized by section. If a writing-styles dir exists (`~/www/writing-styles/`, `~/.claude/writing-styles/`, `~/writing-styles/`), read it for style; attach citation URLs as footnotes.
4. If `publishing=true`, MUST check `agentwiki` is on PATH (`command -v agentwiki`) before invoking it; if absent, mark the publish task skipped and report it — do not fail silently. Otherwise publish via the `agentwiki` CLI. If `publishing=false`, keep local and mark publish skipped.
5. Activate `hs:frontend-design` to build a stunning multi-section HTML file: hero section first (eye-catching), smooth top-to-bottom scroll with parallax, diagrams/illustrations, optional micro-animations, citation footnotes. Remember each section's id/class for capture.
6. Content uses the resolved language preference: `["vi","en"]` bilingual with toggle; `["en"]` English only; `["vi"]` Vietnamese only.
7. If `screenshots=true`, capture each section to `assets/showoff/<mission-name>/images/` with a ratio prefix (`horizontal`/`vertical`/`square`) via the parallel capture script. If `false`, skip capture and mark the task skipped. Commands + `rws` publish-fallback rules: `references/capture-and-preferences.md`.
8. If `publishing=true`, publish/update the static site via `agentwiki` when complete — same PATH check and skip-and-report rule as step 4.
9. Open the resulting HTML with `open` (or equivalent).

## Output Requirements

- Each section fits within the browser viewport; responsive for 16:9, 9:16, 1:1.
- Font supports Vietnamese well when Vietnamese is enabled.
- Theme toggle: system (default) / light / dark.
- Layout never breaks; content never clipped; good on all screen sizes.
- Output images at proper ratio sizes when `screenshots=true`. Modular, maintainable code.
