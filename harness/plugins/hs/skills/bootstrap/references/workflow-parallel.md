# Parallel Workflow (`--parallel`)

**Thinking level:** Ultrathink parallel
**User gates:** Design approval, then normal parallel cook review gates. Implementation uses multi-agent parallel execution after user-approved cook continuation.

## Step 1: Research

Spawn max 2 `@researcher` agents in parallel:
- Explore requirements, validation, challenges, solutions
- Keep reports ≤150 lines

No user gate — proceed automatically.

## Step 2: Tech Stack

Use `@planner` + multiple `@researcher` agents in parallel for best-fit stack. Write to `./docs` directory (≤150 lines).

No user gate — proceed automatically.

## Step 3: Wireframe & Design

1. Use `@ui-ux-designer` + `@researcher` agents in parallel:
   - Research style, trends, fonts, colors, spacing, positions
   - Predict Google Fonts name (NOT just Inter/Poppins)
   - Describe assets for `hs:ai-multimodal` generation
2. `@ui-ux-designer` creates:
   - Design guidelines at `./docs/design-guidelines.md`
   - Wireframes in HTML at `./docs/wireframe/`
3. If no logo: generate with `hs:ai-multimodal` skill
4. Screenshot with `hs:agent-browser` → save to `./docs/wireframe/`

**Gate:** Ask user to approve design. Repeat if rejected.

**Image tools:** `hs:ai-multimodal` for generation/analysis, `imagemagick` for crop/resize, background removal tool as needed.

## Step 4: Parallel Planning

Activate **hs:plan** skill: `/hs:plan --parallel <requirements>`
- Creates phases with **exclusive file ownership** per phase (no overlap)
- **Dependency matrix**: which phases run concurrently vs sequentially
- `plan.md` includes dependency graph, execution strategy, file ownership matrix
- Task hydration with `addBlockedBy` for sequential deps, no blockers for parallel groups

After planning, hand off to cook with normal review gates. Add `--auto` only if the user explicitly asked for autonomous bootstrap.

## Step 5: Parallel Implementation → Final Report

Activate **hs:cook** skill: `/hs:cook --parallel <plan-path>`
- Read `plan.md` for dependency graph and execution strategy
- Launch multiple `@developer` agents in PARALLEL for concurrent phases
  - Pass: phase file path, environment info
- Use `@ui-ux-designer` for frontend (generate/analyze assets with `hs:ai-multimodal`, edit with `imagemagick`)
- Respect file ownership boundaries
- Run type checking after implementation
- Keep cook review gates; `--parallel` controls execution shape, not approval bypass

Cook handles testing, review, docs, onboarding, and the final report.
