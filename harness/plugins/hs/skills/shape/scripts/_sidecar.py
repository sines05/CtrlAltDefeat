"""_sidecar — shared sidecar-record helpers for hs:shape (BA).

`_default_actor`, `_now_iso`, and `_render_file` used to be copy-pasted
byte-identical across every hs:shape sidecar writer (`task_model.py`,
`experiment_spec.py`, `poc_gate.py`, `roadmap_rollup.py`) -- one file-per-
record shape, one actor/timestamp/frontmatter-render convention. Collapsed
here so a future change to any of the three (e.g. the frontmatter render
format) lands once instead of drifting across four copies.

Callers reach it with a plain `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve()
.parent))` + `from _sidecar import ...` (the same dance already used for
`shape_paths`/`effort_map`). This module itself carries ONE edge onto hs:spec:
it pulls the shared `render_common` neutralization through the sanctioned
`_spec_bridge` loader so both the frontmatter and the body use the single-source
strip set the spec render family uses, never a drifting second copy — `_CONTROL_RE`
for the free-text body, and `strip_control` for the frontmatter VALUES pre-dump
(safe_dump does NOT escape a Unicode bidi char, and a post-dump text strip would
retype an unquoted reserved-word scalar; see `_render_file`).
