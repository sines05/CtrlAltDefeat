# hs:debug — systematic root-cause investigation

This skill stops at **root cause + failing repro test**. The actual fix belongs to `hs:fix` — always cross-reference after debugging is complete.

**Core rule**: DO NOT FIX before the root cause is identified. Guess → patch → guess again = waste and new bugs. This out-ranks any proactive / "ship-it-fast" bias — no fix, no "probably", until the root cause has an evidence chain.

**Probe-first ★** (`harness/rules/agent-operational-discipline.md` — the priority discipline): the evidence chain is BUILT by running the real thing — reproduce, instrument, bisect. Reading the stack trace / `--help` / grep / a chain of reasoning is a *hypothesis*, NOT a probe. A cause you have not exercised for real is `[ASSUMED]`, never OBSERVED (the four claim labels:
`harness/rules/verification-mechanism.md`) — confirm it with one real run before you call it root cause.

## Modes / flags

| Mode | When to use |
|---|---|
| (default) | bug / test failure / unexpected behavior — code level |
| `--system` | system incident: server error, CI/CD failure, multi-component |
| `--perf` | performance degradation, slow query, high latency — load `references/performance-diagnostics.md` |
| `--bisect` | unclear which commit caused the regression — load `references/reproduction-and-bisection.md` |

**Inline vs delegate**: run the default / `--perf` / `--bisect` procedures inline. Delegate the whole investigation to `@debugger` when it spans multiple components/services or needs CI+DB+log correlation — that is what `--system` incidents typically need, so `--system` is the usual delegate trigger (see "Delegating the investigation").

## Main procedure (4 phases — code-level)

Load details: `references/root-cause-method.md`.

**Phase 1 — Collect evidence** (required BEFORE thinking about a fix):
- Read the stack trace and error message in full — skip no lines.
- Reproduce the failure consistently: record the exact steps. Cannot reproduce → collect more data.
- Check recent changes: `git log --oneline -20`, diff config, dependency updates.
- Trace data flow: where does the bad value originate? Trace back up the call stack.

**Phase 2 — Analyze patterns**:
- Find similar working code in the repo — compare every difference.
- Identify dependencies: which component, config, or env is involved?

**Phase 3 — Hypothesis → evidence loop**: Load `references/hypothesis-loop.md`.
- Formulate 2-3 competing hypotheses — do not lock onto the first one.
- Test each: smallest possible change, one variable at a time.
- Confirm or eliminate with evidence. If 3+ hypothesis attempts fail → stop, consider the architecture (may need `hs:brainstorm`).
- **When the reasoning itself tangles — ≥ 3 interacting hypotheses (confirming one shifts another) OR a causal chain ≥ 3 hops deep that you are losing track of — you MUST route to `hs:sequential-thinking`** to externalize a labeled, revisable Thought trace (branch / revise / converge) before testing further. This is a DIFFERENT trigger from the 3+-failed-attempts escape above (that goes to
  `hs:brainstorm` / architecture): sequential-thinking is for when the cause IS knowable but the multi-step reasoning no longer fits in your head. Hard route, not a see-also.

**Phase 4 — Finalize root cause + failing repro test**:
- **Write a failing test that reproduces the bug** (`harness/rules/tdd-discipline.md` — red→green rule: test must fail INTENTIONALLY before the fix).
- Do not delegate a fix here — hand the root cause + test to `hs:fix`.

## System procedure (`--system`, 5 steps)

Load `references/instrumentation.md` + `references/root-cause-method.md`.

1. **Initial assessment**: collect symptoms, identify affected components, check recent changes (deploy, config, dep update).
2. **Data collection**: server/app logs for the relevant time window; CI/CD via `gh run view
   <id> --log-failed`; DB state via the project stack's CLI; system metrics.
3. **Analysis**: reconstruct the timeline, identify patterns, trace the request path.
4. **Identify root cause**: systematically eliminate hypotheses; document the full event chain from trigger to symptom.
5. **Propose a fix**: immediate (minimum to restore service) + root fix + preventive (monitoring gap). Actual fix is performed via `hs:fix`.

## Instrumentation and log analysis

Load `references/instrumentation.md` when additional trace/log observation is needed.

Stack-agnostic tools:
- Log parsing: `grep`, `awk`, `sed` — always use `grep --line-buffered` when piping.
- CI/CD: `gh run list --limit 10`, `gh run view <id> --log-failed`.
- DB: project stack CLI (sqlite3, psql, mysql, etc.) per project.
- Codebase: read `docs/codebase-summary.md` if < 2 days old; otherwise use `hs:scout`.

## Skill output

The skill ends with:
1. **Confirmed root cause** (evidence chain, not "possibly").
2. **Failing repro test** committed (or ready to commit) — this test is the input for `hs:fix`.
3. **Report** at `plans/reports/<slug>-debug-report.md` (format: `references/root-cause-method.md` section Report).
4. Cross-reference: `/hs:fix <path-to-failing-test>` — guides user to the next step.

## Delegating the investigation

For complex investigations (multi-component, CI/CD, system), spawn the `@debugger` agent — it runs the full behavioral checklist (gather evidence → 2-3 hypotheses → eliminate → root cause chain → recurrence prevention). Agent reports are written to `plans/reports/`.

```
hs:debug → spawn debugger agent (investigation)
         → failing repro test (tdd-discipline.md)
         → hs:fix (fix)
```

## Boundaries

- Do NOT implement a fix — fixing belongs to `hs:fix`.
- Do NOT skip Phase 1 even if the issue "looks simple".
- Do NOT claim "fixed" without a failing test confirming the root cause.
- If 3+ hypotheses all fail: STOP, reconsider the architecture, ask the user.
- Reports must distinguish "confirmed cause" vs "likely cause" — be honest about certainty.
- If the root cause is a **recurring trap** (would bite again, not a one-off), flag it as a `harness/LESSONS.md` candidate for `/hs:remember` once the fix lands — do not write it here (debug does not mutate).

## HARD-GATE (real wiring)

- `harness/rules/tdd-discipline.md`: a failing repro test is required evidence — no test → debug not complete, cannot hand off to fix.
- `harness/plugins/hs/agents/debugger.md`: the investigation agent has a behavioral checklist (evidence-first, multi-hypothesis, elimination documented).
- Reports → `plans/reports/` (harness-contract rule).

## Red flags — STOP

If you are thinking any of the following, return to Phase 1:
- "Quick fix to get it done, investigate later"
- "Let me try changing X and see"
- "It's probably X, let me just fix it"
- "Tests are passing, done" (when no failing repro test existed beforehand)
