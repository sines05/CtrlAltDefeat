# Release Notes — hs:ship

Guide for generating PR body content and changelog entries. Do not ask the user for content — everything is inferred from diff + commit log.

## Data sources

```bash
# Commit log since the branch diverged
git log origin/<target>..HEAD --oneline

# Full diff to classify and infer context
git diff origin/<target>...HEAD

# Diff stats for the "Changes" section
git diff origin/<target>...HEAD --stat
```

## Commit classification

| Commit prefix | PR body section |
|---------------|-------------|
| `feat:` | Added |
| `fix:` | Fixed |
| `refactor:` / `perf:` | Changed |
| `chore:` / `build:` / `ci:` | (omit or merge into Changed) |
| `docs:` | Documentation |
| `test:` | (omit from user-facing notes) |
| `revert:` | Removed |

If a commit has no conventional prefix → infer from diff content:
- New file → Added
- Deleted file → Removed
- Logic change → Changed

## PR body content

The PR body **structure** (Summary / Linked Issues / Pre-Landing Review / Test Results / Changes / Ship Mode / Human Review Tasks) is defined once, in `references/gate-sequence.md` Step 10 — that is the single source of truth. This file supplies the *content* that fills it: classify commits per the table above for the Summary bullets, pull Pre-Landing Review/Test Results verdicts from Steps 4/9.

**Keep summary bullets short** — one line per change.
**Do not invent test numbers** — use actual output from `hs:test`.

## Changelog entry (if CHANGELOG.md exists)

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- <feat commits>

### Changed
- <refactor/perf commits>

### Fixed
- <fix commits>

### Removed
- <revert / delete commits>
```

Insert the new entry immediately after the file header, before the oldest existing entry.
Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD` using the actual ship date (`date +%Y-%m-%d`).

## PR title

```
type(scope): short description (≤ 70 characters)
```

Infer `type` from the commit majority:
- Mostly `feat:` → `feat`
- Mostly `fix:` → `fix`
- Mixed → type of the most significant commit (by diff size)

`scope` = the module/area most affected (inferred from changed file paths).

## Example

Commit log:
```
feat(gate): add plan-approval artifact check
fix(hook): correct exit code on missing python3
test(e2e): prove gate blocks without approval
```

PR title: `feat(gate): add plan-approval artifact check`

PR summary bullets:
```
