# Mobile Development Skill

Production-ready mobile development with modern frameworks, best practices, and mobile-first thinking patterns.

## When to Use

- Building mobile applications (iOS, Android, or cross-platform)
- Implementing mobile-first design and UX patterns
- Optimizing for mobile constraints (battery, memory, network, small screens)
- Making native vs cross-platform technology decisions
- Implementing offline-first architecture and data sync
- Following platform-specific guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design)
- Optimizing mobile app performance and user experience
- Implementing mobile security and authentication
- Testing mobile applications (unit, integration, E2E)
- Deploying to App Store and Google Play

## Technology Selection Guide

**Cross-Platform Frameworks:**
- **React Native**: JavaScript expertise, web code sharing, mature ecosystem (121K stars, 67% familiarity)
- **Flutter**: Performance-critical apps, complex animations, fastest-growing (170K stars, 46% adoption)

**Native Development:**
- **iOS (Swift/SwiftUI)**: Maximum iOS performance, latest features, Apple ecosystem integration
- **Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose)**: Maximum Android performance, Material Design 3, platform optimization

## Mobile Development Mindset

10 mobile-dev principles (performance-first, offline-first, platform-aware, test-on-real-devices, etc.) — see `references/mobile-mindset.md` for the full list with Reality/Mindset/Action breakdowns.
