# Unified Workflow Steps

All modes share core steps with mode-specific variations.

**Task Tool Fallback:** `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskGet`/`TaskList` are CLI-only — unavailable in VSCode extension. If they error, use `TodoWrite` for progress tracking. All workflow steps remain functional without Task tools.

> **Scope note — hs:cook enters at Step 3.O.** Steps 0–2 (Intent Detection, Research, Planning) are legacy from the pre-split unified workflow and are NOT part of hs:cook. Research and planning belong to `hs:plan`.
> cook's input is already a **human-approved plan**; its pause cadence is governed by `HARNESS_AUTONOMY` (default|ask_all|god), not the `interactive|auto|fast|parallel|no-test|code` mode taxonomy below. When cooking, read from **Step 3.O onward** and treat Steps 0–2 as historical context only.

## Step 0: Intent Detection & Setup

1. Parse input with intent-detection rules
2. Log detected mode: `✓ Step 0: Mode [X] - [reason]`
3. If mode=code: detect plan path, set active plan
4. Use `TaskCreate` to create workflow step tasks (with dependencies if complex)

**Output:** `✓ Step 0: Mode [interactive|auto|fast|parallel|no-test|code] - [detection reason]`

## Step 1: Research (skip if fast/code mode)

**Interactive/Auto:**
- Spawn multiple `hs:researcher` agents in parallel
- Use `/hs:scout ext` or `scout` agent for codebase search
- Keep reports ≤150 lines

**Parallel:**
- Optional: max 2 researchers if complex

**Output:** `✓ Step 1: Research complete - [N] reports gathered`

### [Review Gate 1] Post-Research (skip if auto mode)
- Present research summary to user
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Proceed to planning?" / "Request more research" / "Abort"
- **Auto mode:** Skip this gate

## Step 2: Planning

**Interactive/Auto/No-test:**
- Use `hs:planner` agent with research context
- Create `plan.md` + `phases/phase-*.md` files (scaffold layout)

**Fast:**
- Use `/hs:plan --fast` with scout results only
- Minimal planning, focus on action

**Parallel:**
- Use `/hs:plan --parallel` for dependency graph + file ownership matrix

**Code:**
- Skip - plan already exists
- Parse existing plan for phases

**Output:** `✓ Step 2: Plan created - [N] phases`

### [Review Gate 2] Post-Plan (skip if auto mode)
- Present plan overview with phases
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Validate the plan or approve plan to start implementation?" - "Validate" / "Approve" / "Abort" / "Other" ("Request revisions")
  - "Validate": run `/hs:plan validate` skill invocation
  - "Approve": continue to implementation
  - "Abort": stop the workflow
  - "Other": revise the plan based on user's feedback
- **Auto mode:** Skip this gate

## Step 3: Implementation

### Step 3.O: Open the plan (all modes, before any code)

**Open the plan deterministically** as the first action of implementation — do NOT hand-edit the frontmatter status:

```bash
# Flips plan.md frontmatter status pending|approved -> in_progress (idempotent, surgical).
# The gate's active-plan resolver returns ONLY an in_progress plan: until this runs the
# plan being cooked is invisible to the gate (its verification/review gates are silently
# skipped, or the resolver latches onto a stale in_progress plan from another session).
# The mirror of the Step 6 close. Fails LOUD (exit 1) on a completed/cancelled plan, so
# cook halts rather than cooking a plan the resolver will never see as active.
python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/scripts/open_plan.py <absolute-plan-dir>
```

In `code` mode (which skips Steps 1–2) this is the step that binds the pre-existing plan to the gate; run it right after the Step 0 active-plan detection.

**Output:** `✓ Step 3.O: Plan opened (in_progress)`

**IMPORTANT:**
1. `TaskList` first — check for existing tasks (hydrated by planning skill in same session)
2. If tasks exist → pick them up, skip re-creation
3. If no tasks → read plan phases, `TaskCreate` for each unchecked `[ ]` item with priority order and metadata (`phase`, `planDir`, `phaseFile`)
4. Tasks can be blocked by other tasks via `addBlockedBy`

### Conformance Checklist (before writing code)

Before implementing each phase, the developer agent MUST:

1. **Read `docs/code-standards.md`** and confirm naming, file structure, and error-handling patterns still match the repo.
2. **Scout adjacent code patterns** in the files being modified and follow the same import, logging, and error-wrapping style.
3. **Check for existing helpers** before creating new utilities so the change stays DRY.
4. **Verify interface contracts** so new code extends the current surface instead of creating a parallel one.
5. **Cross-check the plan checklist** so every file in the phase inventory is actually addressed.

After each file is modified:
- **Compile check:** run the relevant project compile/type-check command
- **Pattern verify:** confirm the new code matches adjacent conventions
- **Import check:** confirm no circular dependency or dead import was added

### `--tdd` Flag Behavior

When `--tdd` is active, Step 3 splits into sub-steps per phase:

```
Step 3.T: Write the test for NEW/locked behavior → run it to intentional FAIL (red)
Step 3.I: Implement the minimum to make it pass (green)
Step 3.V: Re-run the full suite → all green + compile gates, then paired commit
```

Step 3.T must be RED before 3.I — that proves the test exercises the new behavior. After 3.I the suite is green; a still-red test means the implementation is incomplete. This mirrors `harness/rules/tdd-discipline.md`, the single source of truth.

**All modes:**
- Use `TaskUpdate` to mark tasks as `in_progress` immediately.
- Execute phase tasks sequentially (Step 3.1, 3.2, etc.)
- Use `hs:ui-ux-designer` for frontend
- On a `mode: hard` plan, each phase's red→green (3.T+3.I) is delegated to a `@developer` subagent even when sequential; main keeps verify + review of the slice's code AND test + commit (see `references/per-phase-tdd.md`)

**Parallel mode:**
- Utilize all tools of Claude Tasks: `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskGet` and `TaskList`
- Launch multiple `hs:developer` agents
- When agents pick up a task, use `TaskUpdate` to assign task to agent and mark tasks as `in_progress` immediately.
- Respect file ownership boundaries
- Wait for parallel group before next

**Output:** `✓ Step 3: Implemented [N] files - [X/Y] tasks complete`

### Step 3.S: Conditional Simplify (live-diff gated)

Recompute signals from the live worktree (no hook state):

```bash
totals=$(git diff --numstat HEAD --ignore-all-space)
loc=$(echo "$totals" | awk '{s+=$1+$2} END {print s+0}')
files=$(echo "$totals" | awk 'NF{c++} END {print c+0}')
maxFile=$(echo "$totals" | awk 'BEGIN{m=0} {if ($1>m) m=$1} END {print m+0}')
modified=$(git diff --name-only HEAD)
```

Read thresholds from harness config (`simplify.threshold.{locDelta,fileCount,singleFileLoc}`),

defaulting to 400 / 8 / 200. If any threshold is breached, spawn the simplifier scoped to the modified files:

```
Task(subagent_type="hs:code-simplifier", prompt="Simplify these files while preserving behavior exactly: [file-list]", description="Simplify recent edits")
```

After the subagent returns, log only — never re-run or block:
- `git diff --shortstat HEAD -- [file-list]` changed → "simplifier made scoped edits"
- unchanged → "simplifier ran clean"

Skip the step entirely when `HARNESS_SIMPLIFY_DISABLED=1` or harness config `simplify.gate.enabled` is `false`.

**Output:** `✓ Step 3.S: Simplify [ran|skipped] - [scoped changes|clean|under threshold]`

### [Review Gate 3] Post-Implementation (skip if auto mode)
- Present implementation summary (files changed, key changes)
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Proceed to testing?" / "Request implementation changes" / "Abort"
- **Auto mode:** Skip this gate

## Step 4: Testing (skip if no-test mode)

**All modes (except no-test):**
- Do NOT write new tests here — each phase's tests were written test-first inside its `@developer` slice (Step 3 red→green); Step 4 runs the EXISTING suite via `@tester`
- **MUST** spawn `hs:tester` subagent: `Task(subagent_type="hs:tester", prompt="Run test suite", description="Run tests")`
- If failures: **MUST** spawn `hs:debugger` subagent → fix → repeat
- **Forbidden:** fake mocks, commented tests, changed assertions, skipping subagent delegation

**Output:** `✓ Step 4: Tests [X/X passed] - tester subagent invoked`

### [Review Gate 4] Post-Testing (skip if auto mode)
- Present test results summary
- Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Proceed to code review?" / "Request test fixes" / "Abort"
- **Auto mode:** Skip this gate

## Step 5: Code Review

**All modes - MANDATORY subagent:**
- **MUST** spawn `hs:code-reviewer` subagent with explicit (a-e) checks and scout/acceptance context
- **DO NOT** review code yourself - delegate to subagent
- Invoke `/hs:code-review` skill for full checklist protocol

**Interactive/Parallel/Code/No-test:**
- Interactive cycle (max 3)
- Requires user approval

**Auto:**
- Auto-approve only if `review-decision.json` is `PASS`, artifact validator passes, and `risk-gate.autoStopRequired` is false
- Auto-fix critical (max 3 cycles)
- Escalate to user after 3 failed cycles

**Fast:**
- Simplified review, no fix loop
- User approves or aborts

**Output:** `✓ Step 5: Review [score]/10 - [Approved|Auto-approved] - code-reviewer subagent invoked`

**Artifact gate:** Step 5 must write review artifacts from `_shared/workflow-artifacts.md` and run the workflow-artifact-gate check.

For high-risk `--auto`, stop with AskUserQuestion before finalize/commit/ship unless `risk-gate.json` has `humanApproved: true`.

## Step 6: Finalize

**All modes - MANDATORY subagents (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
1. **MUST** run sync-back (MANDATORY) — via the `/hs:project-management` skill, or, if that skill was omitted at install (it is opt-in, not spine), the always-present `hs:project-manager` agent — for [plan-path]: reconcile all completed Claude Tasks with all phase files, backfill stale completed checkboxes across every phase, then update plan.md frontmatter/table progress. Do NOT only mark
   current phase.
2. **MUST** spawn in parallel:
   - `Task(subagent_type="hs:docs-manager", prompt="Update docs for changes.", description="Update docs")`
3. Project-management sync-back MUST include:

### Status Sync (Finalize)

Use CLI commands for deterministic status updates:

```bash
# Mark completed phases (harness CLI equivalent)
python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/scripts/autonomy_policy.py --boundary phase

# Or edit per-phase checkboxes directly — only change the Status column cell, preserve table structure
```

   - Sweep all phase files in the plan directory — `phase-XX-*.md` at root AND
     `phases/phase-*.md` in the subdir.
   - Mark every completed item `[ ] → [x]` based on completed tasks (including earlier phases finished before current phase).
   - Return unresolved mappings if any completed task cannot be matched to a phase file.
   - **Close the plan deterministically** once ALL phases are done — do NOT hand-edit the frontmatter status:

```bash
# Flips plan.md frontmatter status in_progress -> completed (idempotent, surgical).
# A plan left in_progress pins the gate's active-plan resolver to a stale plan and
# blocks unrelated shipping — closing it removes that failure mode.
python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/scripts/close_plan.py <absolute-plan-dir>
```
4. Use `TaskUpdate` to mark Claude Tasks complete after sync-back confirmation.
5. Onboarding check (API keys, env vars)
6. **MUST** spawn git subagent: `Task(subagent_type="hs:git-manager", prompt="Stage and commit changes", description="Commit")`

**CRITICAL:** Step 6 is INCOMPLETE without project-management sync-back AND spawning `hs:docs-manager` + `hs:git-manager` subagents. DO NOT skip.

**Auto mode:** Continue to next phase automatically, start from **Step 3**.
**Others:** Ask user before next phase

**Output:** `✓ Step 6: Finalized - 3 subagents invoked - Full-plan sync-back completed - Committed`

## Mode-Specific Flow Summary

Legend: `[R]` = Review Gate (human approval required)

```
interactive: 0 → 1 → [R] → 2 → [R] → 3 → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(user) → 6
auto:        0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5(artifact-gated auto) → 6 → next phase (stops on high risk)
fast:        0 → skip → 2(fast) → [R] → 3 → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(simple) → 6
parallel:    0 → 1? → [R] → 2(parallel) → [R] → 3(multi-agent) → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(user) → 6
no-test:     0 → 1 → [R] → 2 → [R] → 3 → [R] → skip → 5(user) → 6
code:        0 → skip → skip → 3 → [R] → 4 → [R] → 5(user) → 6
```

**Key difference:** `auto` mode skips human review gates only for low-risk, artifact-validated work.

## Critical Rules

- Never skip steps without mode justification
- **MANDATORY DELEGATION:** Steps 4, 5, 6 MUST delegate via Task tool / skill activation. DO NOT implement directly.
  - Step 4: `hs:tester` (and `hs:debugger` if failures)
  - Step 5: `hs:code-reviewer` / `/hs:code-review`
  - Step 6: project-management sync (`/hs:project-management`), `hs:docs-manager`, `hs:git-manager`
- Use `TaskCreate` to create Claude Tasks for each unchecked item with priority order and dependencies (or `TodoWrite` if Task tools unavailable).
- Use `TaskUpdate` to mark Claude Tasks `in_progress` when picking up a task (skip if Task tools unavailable).
- Use `TaskUpdate` to mark Claude Tasks `complete` immediately after finalizing the task (skip if Task tools unavailable).
- All step outputs follow format: `✓ Step [N]: [status] - [metrics]`
- **VALIDATION:** If Task tool calls = 0 at end of workflow, the workflow is INCOMPLETE.
