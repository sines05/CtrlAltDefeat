# hs:scout — structured codebase exploration

Find files, patterns, and code relationships token-efficiently by splitting the codebase and running agents in parallel. Result = scout report in `plans/reports/`.

## Modes / Flags

| Argument | When | Backing |
|---|---|---|
| _(default)_ | internal scouting with `Explore` subagents | `references/internal-scouting.md` |
| `ext` | external scouting with Gemini/OpenCode CLI | `references/external-scouting.md` |

No argument → analyze the prompt and choose the appropriate mode automatically.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze the task
- Parse prompt: search target, extension, directory, pattern.
- Estimate SCALE (agents needed): small ≤3, medium 4-5, large ≥6.
- If SCALE ≤2: do not spawn subagents — use Grep/Glob directly (overhead not worth it).

### 2. Divide and conquer
- Partition the codebase by directory/pattern — no overlap.
- Each agent receives a distinct, clearly scoped assignment.

### 3. Register tasks (when SCALE ≥ 3)
- `TaskList` first — check for existing scout tasks and reuse if present.
- If none: `TaskCreate` per agent, mark `in_progress` before spawning.
- Schema detail: `references/task-management.md`.

### 4. Spawn agents in parallel
- **Route first through `hs:workflow-orchestrate`** (before any spawn) — state `reason` (why this scout fan-out), `strategy` (mode + base + angle→count), `scope` (SCALE + directory surface, variable count).
  Scout's count is **variable** (SCALE from step 1), so the route also sizes/groups: consume `route_depth` — `light` → proceed via the fallback below; `agent` → escalate the `@workflow-orchestrator` agent before spawning.
  The exact sizing commands + the `groupCap`/`earlyWrite` handoff live in `harness/rules/orchestration-protocol.md`.
- **ultracode opt-in present** → orchestrate the parallel fan-out (+ mechanical path-dedup) via the shared `Workflow({name:"hs:base-fanout-consolidate", args:{lenses, findingsSchema, dedupKeyFields}})` (one lens per search-angle; deterministic fan-out; `scriptPath` if the name is not registered). Search-angle prompts are built as data, not callbacks.
- **opt-in absent** (mandatory fallback — Workflows are plan-gated) → the inline parallel spawns below:
  - **Internal (default):** `references/internal-scouting.md` (Explore subagents — spawn each with `model:"haiku"`, see that reference).
  - **External (ext):** `references/external-scouting.md` (Gemini/OpenCode CLI).
  - Send all spawns in a single message (1 message = true parallelism).
  - 3-minute timeout per agent — drop unresponsive agents, do not retry.
- **Stamp** the path that ran (`Workflow(name)` | `Workflow(scriptPath)` | `inline-Task fallback`) in the report. Resolve the opt-in per `harness/rules/orchestration-protocol.md`.
- **Route-all (gemini partner lane, opt-in — DORMANT at factory)** — before the fan-out, check `python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/scripts/gemini_partner_config.py --should-route scout`.
Factory default is `claude` (mode=partner) so this branch does nothing on a shipped install. Only when it prints `route` (mode=route-all AND scout ∈ `route_all_surface`) run each search-angle through the single chokepoint —
  `python3 "${HARNESS_BIN_ROOT:-.}"/harness/plugins/hs/scripts/gemini_companion.py research -p "<angle>"` — and consume its provenance-stamped JSON. A `degraded`/`inert` reply → record **"degraded to claude"** LOUDLY and fall back to the native scout, never a silent swap.

### 5. Collect + report
- `TaskUpdate` each task: `completed` or `metadata.error: "timeout"`.
- Merge results, deduplicate paths, write scout report to `plans/reports/`.
- Return absolute path of the report + list of open questions.

## Report format

```markdown
# Scout Report — <target>

## Relevant files
- `/absolute/path/to/file.py` — short description

## Observed patterns

## Open questions
```

## Boundaries

- DO NOT edit code or create files outside `plans/reports/`.
- Scout output is input for `hs:research` (external), `hs:debug`, `hs:fix`,
  `hs:code-review` — scout does not make implementation decisions.
- The `ext` flag requires Gemini/OpenCode to be installed; if missing → fall back to internal automatically and record `[FALLBACK_INTERNAL]` in the report.
- Large context budget (SCALE ≥ 6): check `hs:context-engineering` before spawning.
- To pack the full repo before scouting: use `hs:repomix` (outputs one XML file for the LLM).

## HARD-GATE (real wiring)

- Reports must exist only inside `plans/reports/` — CLAUDE.md rule #3. Creating markdown outside this directory violates the CI invariant.
- Scout does not approve or implement anything — all next steps require a human or another skill that takes the scout report as input.
