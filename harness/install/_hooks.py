"""_hooks.py — settings.json hook-wiring transforms for the installer.

Pure transforms over the hook registration, split out of install.py so the
orchestrator stays thin:
  - load_registration: parse hooks-registration.yaml from the source tree;
  - materialize_hooks: build Claude Code's settings `hooks` object from it,
    translating the `$HARNESS_ROOT` placeholder to "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR";
  - merge_hooks: additively merge into a user's existing hooks (dedup by command,
    never clobber) — idempotent;
  - strip_harness_hooks: drop only harness-owned hooks back out on uninstall.

install.py re-exports these names, so callers and tests that reach them through
the `install` module see no change.
