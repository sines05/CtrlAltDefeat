"""courier_tree.py — build the plugin *courier* tree from a scrubbed pack tarball.

The courier is the cache payload a Claude Code marketplace ships: a thin plugin
whose job is to CARRY the engine to the machine, not to run skills from the cache.
Its shape is:

    <out>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json   # name "harness", version from release.json
    <out>/bin/                         # dispatcher lives here (filled in phase 3)
    <out>/engine/harness/...           # the engine, copied to the stable home by setup

INPUT CONTRACT (red-team F1, enforced by mechanism, not discipline): the ONLY
accepted input is a tarball produced by release/pack.build_tarball — which has
ALREADY restored the protective protected-branches floor and seeded LESSONS.md.
Handing this builder the live repo directory is REFUSED: a dev tree carries an
empty floor / accumulated LESSONS entries that must never reach a published
payload. Reading a tarball (already scrubbed) is the only path in.

The engine's own test tree (harness/tests/**) and any stashed disabled skills
(harness/plugins/hs/disabled-skills/**) are dropped from the courier — they are
dev/CI weight, not runtime.
