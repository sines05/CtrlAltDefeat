"""run_eval_bootstrap_slice.py — end-to-end dogfood for hs:eval-bootstrap.

Proves the generated eval framework actually RUNS, not just that it parses:

  SLICE 1 (ground-truth, 0-API-key) — scaffold a ground-truth tree, fill the
    domain stubs the way the model would (a key:value pipeline mirror and a
    pass-rate scorer), then run the generated run_production_evals.py as a REAL
    subprocess: a clean fixture exits 0 (all fields MATCH after normalisation),
    and mutating one ground-truth field exits 1 (block-then-pass). No import
    cheating.

  SLICE 2 (fake-judge, 0-API-key) — scaffold a judge tree, inject a FIXED fake
    judge output (no LLM), and prove the judge is ADVISORY ONLY: build_judge_prompt
    runs without the source's .format KeyError, and attach_judge_advisory leaves
    the deterministic maturity + passed verdict UNCHANGED (VL-2).

  SLICE 3 (data extraction) — run the generated extract_data_text.py: the image
    branch (no OCR) is exercised dep-free; the PDF branch runs only when pymupdf
    is installed (skip-guarded otherwise).

  SLICE 4 (L1 + card integrity) — a scaffold call missing a required judgment
    arg refuses (never defaults); a full-arg scaffold + card write + verify all
    pass; a hand-edited eval_config.json makes the stamped run_production_evals.py
    refuse to score (exit 2, config drift) — the card-hash integrity loop.

  SLICE 5 (R9 sandbox evidence) — a clean fill runs cleanly through
    sandbox_run.py under BOTH the fallback and bwrap containment seams (the
    seam is re-injected AFTER _clean_env, never inherited); a fill importing
    socket is refused before it ever executes (denylist, exit 3), proven by an
    absent marker file; under bwrap, a write to a runtime-computed path outside
    the sandbox is blocked at the OS level, never reaching the real host path.

  SLICE 6 (two-tier memory) — a lesson (tier-1, tracked per-repo) and a
    standard (tier-2, per-machine — routed via an explicitly re-injected
    HARNESS_STATE_DIR) are appended, then recalled with a filter + limit;
    email/phone redaction is asserted at the raw byte level, and the real
    per-OS home directory is proven untouched throughout.

  SLICE 7 (mutation matrix) — a real check_p0_gates fill generates + runs a
    mutation matrix that matches every expectation (p0-kill, +-epsilon
    threshold, noise-no-panic); a placeholder tree (check_p0_gates left as the
    stamped stub) fails the run and is classified as a blind gate.

  SLICE 8 (subprocess mirror, non-python lang) — scaffold a lane with
    mirror_lang "fakelang" (python plays the exotic interpreter named in the
    card's mirror_invoke, proving the any-language path needs nothing
    installed): the non-python lane stamps a mirror-implementation guide +
    test_mirror_contract.py instead of pipeline_mirror.py; emit the
    mirror_contract.json from the approved card, "LLM fill" the mirror file
    it names, then drive run_production_evals.py through the subprocess
    dispatch — clean exit 0, mutated ground truth exit 1 (block-then-pass
    through the subprocess), the stamped contract tests pass against the
    filled mirror, and a hand-edited mirror_contract.json card_hash makes the
    runner die loud (ConfigDriftError) rather than score against a drifted
    contract.

All writes land under a tempfile workspace; nothing here touches the real repo.
Every subprocess this file spawns builds its env from `_clean_env()` (scrubs
every HARNESS_* var) so a stray dev-session override never leaks in and
produces a false result; slices 5/6 re-inject one HARNESS_* seam explicitly,
AFTER the scrub, exactly where the containment/state-dir behavior needs it.
