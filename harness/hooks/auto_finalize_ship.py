"""auto_finalize_ship.py — PreToolUse(Skill) hook: ship-belt backstop that
finalizes the single active plan when N/N phases have a PASS snapshot.

Layer 2 to phase_progress_writer's Layer 1. The writer closes a plan at the
moment its FINAL phase verification is written. But a run can reach hs:ship by a
path where that last write never fired the hook (an out-of-band edit, a hook miss,
a resumed session). This belt re-checks at the publish boundary: resolve the ONE
active plan (resolve_active_plan — never a corpus scan) and finalize it, gated on
the same derived N/N evidence. Complete -> close; incomplete -> benign no-op.

Scoped to hs:ship / ship only — NOT hs:git, whose mid-cook commits would
otherwise trigger an early close. Shares the HARNESS_AUTO_FINALIZE kill-switch
with the writer (one knob, both seams). Telemetry-class: fail-open, never blocks.

Hook stdin protocol: { tool_name: "Skill", tool_input: { skill }, ... }.
