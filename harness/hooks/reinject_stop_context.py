"""reinject_stop_context.py — Stop-event hook: re-inject working context on a
/goal continuation.

A /goal loop continues via the Stop event, NOT a user prompt, so UserPromptSubmit
never fires and the within-window refresh block is never re-injected — it decays over a
long autonomous run (measured 0/30 inject-rate on STOP_HOOK_FEEDBACK). This hook
re-emits build_slim_context() — the SLIM refresh block carrying the live voice register,
active plan/branch, naming stamp, and the rule/CLAUDE.md pointer — via the shared
co-emit chokepoint on each continuation (stop_hook_active), keeping the loop on-voice
and rule-aware. (It deliberately re-injects SLIM, not the heavy diet-B block: the loop
needs the register refreshed, not the full paths/plan sections re-sent every tick.)

NOTE: This hook gates on goal_status met:false (goal-specific). An AFK loop that does
NOT use /goal (e.g., native loop_controller) is NOT covered — it runs through a
different continuation path. If AFK context injection is needed, wire the AFK runner
to call build_context() directly or set up a separate Stop hook.

A Stop hook's `decision: block` re-invokes the model with `reason` as its context
(documented Stop channel; probe-verified CC 2.1.201) — there is no passive inject
channel on Stop — so an ungated re-inject
self-sustains the loop and keeps firing after the goal is met (observed ~88 extra
turns past goal_status met:true). Therefore emission is GATED: emit only while a /goal
is live-and-unmet (transcript's last goal_status is met:false); on met:true / no
marker / any error we stay silent and ride no turn of our own. Default ON; disable
with HARNESS_REINJECT_STOP=0. Telemetry-class + fail-open: never blocks the loop.
