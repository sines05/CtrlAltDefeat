"""plannotator_wrapper_guard.py — PreToolUse compliance gate: force the annotate review
through the wrapper.

Two entries, one module, one break-glass switch:
  * bash_core  — PreToolUse(Bash): blocks a bare `plannotator annotate ...` shell command
    (typed by hand, or a bare-skill !command if it surfaces as a Bash tool call).
  * skill_core — PreToolUse(Skill): blocks a Skill(plannotator-annotate) call before the
    bare !command can even run (the primary model channel).

Both redirect to the wrapper `harness/scripts/plannotator_surface.py annotate`, which
injects `--gate` + globs the whole phase directory: the reviewer then sees every phase
file and gets a real Approve button on the plan. A bare invocation lacks `--gate` → the
UI opens annotation-only (Send/Close, no Approve) → the review session closes with no
decision. Fixing a repeated failure that had only prose advice behind it before.

Scope is annotate ONLY: `review` has no `--gate` flag in the binary, so a bare `review`
== the wrapper `review` at the command level — gating it would buy tracing, not an Approve
button, so it is deliberately left alone (with the other 4 plannotator skills). The wrapper
itself passes both gates: its command token is `plannotator_surface.py` (not
`plannotator annotate`), and it shells out to the binary via subprocess INSIDE Python —
not a Bash tool call, so no hook sees it.

Posture: compliance class — but the RUNTIME crash/timeout path fails OPEN. This gate is in
the "redirect" family (like disabled_skill_router / explore_model_guard): a hard block whose
own runtime error must never wedge a whole session's Bash or Skill lane. Each core swallows
its own runtime errors → None, and both dispatch rows carry `fail_open: true` as the second
belt. (A module-LOAD failure — a broken import or a renamed entry — still fails closed at the
dispatcher like every other gate; that is the dispatcher's contract, not this gate's to
override.) Only a real "bare annotate" decision returns a reason and blocks.

Residual (documented, not chased): a determined operator can spell around the Bash regex
(`bash -c "..."`, `$(...)`, `pla""nnotator`, an alias) — the same not-airtight class the
bash_safety_guard template already accepts. The model rarely fights its own guard, and the
Skill lane catches the model-tool path regardless.

HOOK_CLASS is a code constant; config (harness-hooks.yaml) can only toggle enabled/mode,
never reclassify the gate. Break-glass: `plannotator_wrapper_guard: {enabled: false}`
silences BOTH lanes (both dispatch rows share the name) — the diff is tracked and the
skip is visible.
