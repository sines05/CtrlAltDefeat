"""write_guard.py — tool-mediated config-edit gate (compliance, fail-closed).

PreToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit): block when the target is one of
the files the gate posture depends on. Under a GLOBAL install one shared binary
serves many projects, so the gate resolves TWO roots and guards TWO zones:

  bin zone (read-only, shared)   — the ENTIRE bin_root() tree. When bin≠project a
      tool-Write to ANY path under the bin is blocked for every actor: the bin
      holds .claude/settings.json (the guard on/off switch), CLAUDE.md,
      scripts/, orchestrator/ — a harness/-only fence would let a foreign project
      overwrite the hook registration and disable ALL guards (red-team F1).
  project zone (writeable, per-project) — the project-lane GUARD_LIST patterns
      (docs/decisions.*, plans/*/artifacts/plan-approval.*) matched relative to
      the PROJECT root so they stay guarded even when the binary lives elsewhere
      (C3).

Self-host / dogfood (bin==project) collapses to today's single-root behavior:
detected by HARNESS_BIN_ROOT being UNSET (a global bin is itself a git checkout,
so a `.git` walk-up would wrongly collapse it — red-team F2). Under a global
layout with an unresolved project root the gate FAILS CLOSED (blocks a guarded
project-tail write, never a silent allow — C5/F2). Containment is case-insensitive
(F6) so a case-variant bin path cannot dodge it on macOS/Windows.

GUARD_LIST is a CODE CONSTANT: config can only ADD paths (write-guard.yaml
`extra_guarded`), never remove one — a config knob that can shrink the guard is a
guard that does not exist.

HONESTY — the name is the scope: this is a tool-mediated CONFIG-EDIT gate. It sees
Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit tool calls and nothing else. It does NOT see a
Bash redirect (`echo > file`), a `cp`/`sed -i` into the bin, or an editor outside
the session — those paths are the documented tamper-EVIDENT floor (git diff,
manifest verify, pre-push scrub). For a SHARED bin the git-diff floor evaporates
(the diff lands in the bin's repo, which the foreign operator never reviews), so
true shared-binary integrity requires the bin be OS-level read-only to the runtime
user — that is the real fence, documented in the phase-7 install doc, NOT a claim
this gate makes.

Enable-path autonomy: the guard resolves its enabled flag ONLY from
write-guard.yaml in the bin tree's harness/data/ (tracked in git) — never
HARNESS_HOOK_CONFIG, so one env var cannot switch it off. Fail-closed is local:
this hook reimplements the run_compliance_hook exception→exit-2 discipline rather
than reusing it (that wrapper carries an env-driven enable path).
