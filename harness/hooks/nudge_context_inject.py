"""nudge_context_inject.py — UserPromptSubmit hook (telemetry-class) re-surfacing
turn-end nudge observations to the MODEL as additionalContext.

Several nudges record an observation at turn-end (stderr + trace) but the model
never re-reads stderr or the trace. This hook closes that loop: at a later
UserPromptSubmit it reads the latest same-session observation(s) and injects a
one-line additionalContext so the model can act. Two kinds are surfaced:

  - decision-capture (`decision_capture_observation`) -> point at /hs:remember.
  - standards-drift (`standards_drift_observation` / `..._commit_observation`)
    -> point at /hs:docs (arch/standards code changed without resyncing the
    auto-loaded prose docs).
  - memory-gap (`memory_gap_observation`) -> point at the memory-gap detail
    (H2-resolved: the model-aimed "memory_gap thường" leg; a fence_breach signal
    ALSO gets an immediate systemMessage from memory_gap_hook itself — this relay
    is the belt-and-suspenders follow-up next turn, not the only channel).
  - backlog-capture (`backlog_capture_observation`) -> point at
    backlog_register.py add (H2-resolved MEDIUM).
  - goal-cycle (`goal_cycle_observation`) -> point at the cycle_N.md breadcrumb
    convention (H2-resolved MEDIUM).

Single-shot PER KIND: each kind carries its own per-session marker (the last
surfaced ts), so surfacing one kind never suppresses the other, and neither
re-nags on every subsequent prompt. A NEWER observation supersedes its marker.

INTERACTIVE-ONLY by construction. The AFK loop drives `claude -p`, which never
fires UserPromptSubmit, so this inject is inert in an autonomous run.

Advisory only (telemetry contract): it never blocks. On any error — or when
telemetry is disabled, or no fresh observation exists — it emits no context
(fail-open: a broken inject degrades to "no reminder", never to a blocked session).
