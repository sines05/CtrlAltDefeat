"""inject_prompt_context.py — context re-injection hook (telemetry-class).

CLAUDE.md is loaded near the top of each context window; within a long window it
drifts up and out of the model's working attention, and its conventions get
forgotten. This hook re-states the load-bearing rules on a decay-aware cadence —
NOT every prompt (that re-states freshly-loaded rules for no gain), but on the
two moments the working context actually goes stale:

  - SessionStart (startup / resume / clear / compact): arm a re-inject for the
    next prompt — the window just turned over, dynamic context (branch, active
    plan, paths) should be re-surfaced.
  - UserPromptSubmit: re-inject every N turns within a window, so a long stretch
    refreshes the rules before CLAUDE.md has drifted too far up.

Beyond the static rules it carries the DYNAMIC context a fixed file cannot: the
current git branch, the active plan's absolute path, and the dated report/plan
naming pattern (absolute paths so a deep CWD never spawns a stray plans/ subtree).

Ported harness-native from the upstream dev-rules-reminder + context-builder
(MIT). Rebranded on port: points at the harness rule layer (`harness/rules/`,
routed from CLAUDE.md), never `.claude/`. The upstream throttled on a 5-minute
wall-clock TTL; this uses a turns + session-boundary signal instead (decay
tracks context growth, not elapsed time). The active-plan path is salvaged from
the upstream cook-after-plan-reminder.

Telemetry-class + fail-open: advisory only, it NEVER blocks. Disabled, any
exception, or malformed stdin -> a plain continue (a broken context hook
degrades to "no reminder", never to a blocked prompt). Never raises, never
exits 2. Mirrors voice_inject's emit plumbing.
