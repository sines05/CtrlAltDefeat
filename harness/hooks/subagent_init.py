"""subagent_init.py — SubagentStart context injector (telemetry, fail-open).

When a subagent is spawned, inject the FULL resolved register — the same block the
main session receives at SessionStart, built by the shared register_block builder so
the two surfaces cannot drift — followed by the existing pointer at the harness rule
layer, the standards tree, and an ownership reminder, the RBAC write-scope reminder
(hoisted here so it reaches default agents that carry no authored .md), and a one-line
reinforcement that extends the voice scope-fence over ALL the subagent's output
(reasoning, reports, and messages back to the lead — not only the journal/critique
cases the fence names).

Why the full register: any subagent can generate code, so the code_style/audience
directives must reach it too; gating by agent_type would buy a branch for little —
the code_style body is inert for a report-only agent. The scope-fence travels with
the register verbatim, so the voice scope-fence invariant (the knob never touches code/reports)
holds by construction on this path too.

Alongside the register it also carries a standards read-DIRECTIVE (a read-order, never
the file body): a task that writes/modifies code or tests is told to open
docs/code-standards.md first, and docs/system-architecture.md for a structural change.
The directive self-gates on the task ("IF you write/modify …") so no agent-type
allowlist is needed, and it rides BOTH return paths like the RBAC reminder.

Posture: telemetry, fail-OPEN — emits at most an additionalContext string and ALWAYS
exits 0. Disabled or any exception → the generic pointer (or no context), never a
blocked subagent. The register build is wrapped so an import/read failure degrades to
the pointer alone rather than dropping the spawn.
