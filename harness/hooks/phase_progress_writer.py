"""phase_progress_writer.py — PostToolUse hook: per-phase evidence snapshot +
plan lifecycle (auto-open, auto-close).

A plan's canonical verification.{json,yaml} is OVERWRITTEN every phase (it is the
current-phase verdict the gate reads O(1)). That makes it useless for "are all N
phases done?" — by the time you ask, only the last phase's verdict survives. This
hook keeps a per-phase copy so completion can be DERIVED, not asserted: when a
verification carrying verdict PASS + a phase id is written, copy it once to
verification-<phase>.json (first-wins, never overwriting an existing snapshot).

Enforced, not advised: the agent keeps writing ONE verification.json per phase as
it already does (per-phase-tdd.md); the hook owns the per-phase naming. So the
completion count cannot be gamed by a forgotten/duplicated suffix.

The snapshot + lifecycle logic lives in verification_snapshot.py (a shared
module) so this hook and write_verification.py drive the exact same code path —
a Bash-written verification (which never trips PostToolUse) gets an identical
snapshot through the script. This hook is the fallback for the Write-tool path.

After the snapshot — and gated by HARNESS_AUTO_FINALIZE (kill-switch leaves the
snapshot, drops the flips) — the hook drives the plan it JUST wrote to through its
lifecycle: auto-open (pending|approved -> in_progress) and finalize (close ONLY at
N/N phases). It only ever touches the plan whose verification was written.

The snapshot/flip writes are plain file I/O (not the Write tool), so they neither
re-trigger PostToolUse nor trip write_guard. The matcher excludes
verification-*.json so a direct write of a snapshot never self-triggers either.

Telemetry-class: fail-open, scoped to plans/<p>/artifacts/verification.{json,yaml}.
Hook stdin protocol: { tool_name, tool_input: { file_path }, ... }.
