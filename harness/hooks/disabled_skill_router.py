"""disabled_skill_router.py — PreToolUse(Skill) block-with-map for an off skill.

When the model invokes the Skill tool on a skill this install DISABLED (omitted at the
dir level), this gate blocks the raw call and replies with the three sanctioned ways
forward — the "block-with-map" (router chặn-kèm-bản-đồ):

    1. /hs:use <name>                       — the proxy that loads + runs the off skill
    2. read the stash SKILL.md at <abs path> — do it inline
    3. hs_cli.py skills --enable <name>     — turn it back on

A live or unknown target passes silently — the router only ever speaks to redirect an
off skill, never to slow a normal call.

HOOK_CLASS = compliance: it exits 2 to BLOCK. Deliberate, documented deviation from the
compliance contract (shared with explore_model_guard): an INTERNAL ERROR fails OPEN
(exit 0) so a broken disabled-state source — a corrupt omit record, an unlistable stash —
does NOT brick every skill call in the session. Only a real "target is disabled" decision
exits 2, and that exit sits OUTSIDE the fail-open try so a broad except can never swallow
it and turn the gate dark. The single switch is the registration toggle
`disabled_skill_router.enabled` (compliance default True).

Whether PreToolUse(Skill) even fires for an omitted skill (the host may validate the
enum-catalog before hooks run) is the live probe deferred to P3; the same 3-path map also
reaches the model via disabled_ref_nudge + hs:use, so the deliverable never rests on this
hook alone.
