"""bash_write_guard.py — PostToolUse:Bash advisory (telemetry-class, fail-open).

write_guard (PreToolUse:Write|Edit|MultiEdit) blocks the agent's FILE tools from
editing gate config, but it is structurally blind to a write spelled through the
shell: a redirect (`> file`, `>> file`), `tee`, `sed -i`, or a `python -c
"open(path,'w')"`. This hook closes the visibility gap, not the write: it runs
PostToolUse — AFTER the command already ran — so it CANNOT block. It does the one
honest thing left: detect that a guarded path was written through Bash, record it
to the telemetry ledger, and nudge. The edited file is tracked, so the change
also surfaces as a git diff. Defense-in-depth surfacing (tamper-EVIDENT), exactly
the floor write_guard documents — never an airtight gate.

Deliberately NOT flagged: `cp`/`mv` into a guarded path. That is the SANCTIONED
workaround for editing a guarded file (write to /tmp, then cp/mv into place); it
is explicit and visible, so nagging on it would punish the blessed path. Reading
a guarded file and redirecting ELSEWHERE (`cat guarded > /tmp/x`) is not a write
to it and stays silent — only the WRITE TARGET is matched, never a source arg.

Posture: telemetry-class (default ON, fail-open, always continues). The detection
is a heuristic over the command string, in lockstep with write_guard's GUARD_LIST
and root resolution (one guarded set, two observers).
