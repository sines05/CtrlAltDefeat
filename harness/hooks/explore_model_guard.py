"""explore_model_guard.py — PreToolUse(Agent|Task) gate: enforce the model-bound posture.

Historically pinned only Explore to haiku; now enforces the per-agent bound declared in
model-policy.yaml for ANY subagent-type (exact / ceiling <= / floor >= / require-explicit).
A subagent inherits the session model unless the caller passes one, which is expensive or
wrong for many roles; this gate fires when the effective model violates the agent's bound,
consults the posture, and blocks (default) / advises / stays silent, with a reasoned escape
marker for a genuine need. (Filename kept for registration/manifest stability — see BACKLOG.)

Effective model:
  - an explicit tool_input.model wins;
  - a self_pinned agent (frontmatter sets its own model) trusts a bare inherit;
  - otherwise the LIVE session model, read from the transcript tail (a /model switch is
    honored) with the ANTHROPIC_MODEL env as a best-effort fallback.

Tier comparison maps THROUGH ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL and FAILS OPEN on a custom/collapsed
mapping (model_policy.evaluate) — a custom model setup is never false-blocked.

HOOK_CLASS = compliance: it exits 2 to BLOCK. Deliberate, documented deviation from the
compliance contract (shared with simplify_gate): an INTERNAL ERROR
fails OPEN (exit 0) so a lỗi vặt does not wedge the whole session; only a real block
decision exits 2. The block path sits OUTSIDE the fail-open try and the except re-raises
SystemExit, so a broad except can never swallow the exit-2 and turn the gate dark (F4).

NO env knob. There is deliberately
no environment gate that would default this hook OFF and ship it dark, against the design
(default ON block). The ONLY switch is the registration toggle `explore_model_guard.enabled`
(compliance default True).

Best-effort (Khung-1): a spawn that inherits an unclassifiable model (custom mapping) is
allowed by design; the intent-first block message + the prose docs are the real mitigation.
