"""agent_rbac_guard.py — PreToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit) compliance gate keyed on agent_type.

Reads the role straight off the PreToolUse payload (`agent_type` / `subagent_type`
for a subagent tool call; absent for the top-level agent → `_parent`) — NOT via
resolve_actor, which collapses parent/sub because session_id is shared. Two clauses:

  1. ISOLATION floor — a subagent (non-_parent role) may only write UNDER its
     cwd/worktree root (resolve-then-contain; a worktree-isolated subagent is thus
     physically confined). The top-level agent is exempt.
  2. IDENTITY lane — within the root, the target must match the role's declared
     write globs in agent-permissions.yaml.

A violation is BLOCKED fail-closed via run_compliance_hook (exit 2 + reason),
softened to a warn under the lenient guard policy (registered _ENFORCE).

ROLE RESOLUTION: a fully ABSENT attribution is the real top-level agent (`_parent`).
A PRESENT-but-empty/blank attribution is instead a DRIFTED subagent (its agent_type
vanished) — it is mapped to a confined `_drifted` sentinel, NOT `_parent`, so an
attribution glitch fails toward containment (default_deny blocks it), never toward
write-everything. A namespaced role (`hs:developer`) is de-namespaced to its bare
table key inside agent_permissions.

ISOLATION ROOT (global-install aware): the confinement root is the payload `cwd`
(the subagent's worktree) > `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` > the per-project root derived
from data_root(). Under a global bin with NO worktree cwd and NO project dir the
root is UNRESOLVED — a confined role then fails CLOSED (blocked) rather than
decaying to the hook process CWD (the old `"."` fallback), which would silently
confine a subagent to wherever the hook happened to run.

HONESTY (mirrors write_guard/fs_guard): `agent_type` is a platform-set ATTRIBUTION
label, not a credential — this disciplines a cooperative fleet on a trusted host, it
is NOT insider-proof and does NOT judge intent (a hijacked-but-in-role write is
byte-identical at the gate). It sees tool Writes, not Bash-spelled writes
(`echo>`, `sed -i`) — those need the worktree boundary + the git-diff floor.
Hostile multi-tenant authz stays on the separate server-issued-token path.

Additive-skip: an absent / roleless table → inert (pass, no isolation either), so a
fresh install never bricks the fleet. A present-but-malformed table fails closed.
