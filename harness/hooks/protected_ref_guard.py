"""protected_ref_guard.py — PreToolUse(Bash) compliance hook: protect refs.

Refuses three dangerous Bash commands, defense-in-depth ahead of the transport
pre-push hook (which is the authoritative floor — it reads git's real ref
stdin and is immune to command-string spelling):
  * force-push / history-rewrite to a protected ref — FLOOR
    (protected_ref_force_push, never lowered by a preset).
  * deletion of a protected ref (`git push origin :main` / `--delete`) — same
    FLOOR (deleting a protected branch is as destructive as a rewrite).
  * a direct `git commit` while the current branch is protected — enforcement
    (protected_ref_commit, lowers to warn under lenient).

Whether a command IS a push/commit is decided by stage_detector (the same
boundary-strict detector the stage gate uses), so env-assignment and
exec-wrapper prefixes (`sudo`, `env`, `VAR=val …`) and option spellings are
handled consistently with the rest of the harness. Target extraction
over-approximates in the SAFE direction: a false refusal on a FLOOR guard is
recoverable via a logged break-glass, a miss is a hole. A missing
protected-branch policy protects nothing (additive).
