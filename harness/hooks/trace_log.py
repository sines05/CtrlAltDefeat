"""trace_log.py — append-only AUDIT trace (telemetry-class lib).

One JSONL line per event into state/trace/trace-YYYYMMDD.jsonl. This is the
audit ledger: gate decisions, session starts, approvals, DEC writes.
It NEVER rotates or truncates — usage counters live in telemetry_paths and
rotate there; audit history must survive intact.

Schema (learned from CK hook-logger shape; written new):
  ts, actor, session, hook, event, tool, target, status, exit, dur_ms, note,
  payload_hash (sha256 12-hex of tool_input when given — payload itself is
  NOT stored: hash links the trace line to the op without leaking content),
  chain_hash (sha256 64-hex linking record-to-record within the daily file).

Fail-open: tracing must never break the operation being traced.
