"""session_init.py — SessionStart hook (telemetry-class).

Resolves the acting identity once per session and caches it in
state/sessions/<session_id>.json so later hooks in the same session resolve
the SAME actor through resolve_actor(session_id=...) instead of re-reading a
possibly-changed environment. The cache is an optimization, never a
prerequisite: hooks fall back to the env chain when this never ran.

Also garbage-collects leaked rule_nudge dedup markers (see
_gc_stale_nudge_markers). Emits a session_start audit event.
