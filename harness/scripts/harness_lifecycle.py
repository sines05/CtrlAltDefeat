"""harness_lifecycle.py — the courier's on-PATH lifecycle tool.

Verbs (surfaced by the `harness` wrapper on PATH):

  setup [--pin] [--harden-bin] [--uninstall]
      Copy the engine out of the plugin cache into the stable engine home
      (~/.local/share/harness/<version>), verify it BEFORE repointing `current`
      (red-team F5), then wire the CURRENT repo per-project: HARNESS_BIN_ROOT into
      settings.local.json (F3 — never the global ~/.claude), hooks, the plugin
      marketplace (absolute path into the engine home), and the .harness/ skeleton.
  upgrade
      Copy + verify + swap `current` to the cache version, side-by-side with the
      old one. Does NOT touch repo wiring. A live session on `current` sees the new
      engine from its next hook call (F10 — session-pin is a backlog item).
  version   — engine-home version, cache version, and which source is running.
  path [rel]— print the engine root (or <root>/<rel>) — a deterministic net for prose.
  doctor    — INTEGRITY check (manifest-hash of the engine home, F8) + advisory
              cache↔home skew (DEC handshake: advisory, never a hard block).

Audience: this is a shipped, on-PATH tool (distinct from hs_cli.py, the in-repo
dev CLI). It reuses the installer's global-mode wiring helpers verbatim.
