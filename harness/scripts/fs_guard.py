"""fs_guard — script-path containment helper for harness script writes.

A harness script that resolves its target through `assert_under(path, zone)`
BEFORE opening the file cannot write outside the zone's declared root(s):
`..` traversal, symlink escape, and prefix look-alikes (`docs-extra`) are all
defeated by resolve-then-contain. The zone table is DATA-DRIVEN from
harness/data/ownership.yaml — adding a zone is a config edit, not a code edit.

Two-root binding (global install): a zone's base root depends on which tree the
zone lives in. Project zones (docs/plans/state) are PER-PROJECT and resolve
against the project root; the bin zone (standards) is SHIPPED and resolves
against the bin root. Under a global layout (HARNESS_BIN_ROOT set) fs_guard is
authoritative — it picks the base per zone regardless of the `root` a caller
passes, so a caller that still hands over bin-root (e.g. plan_approval) cannot
mis-zone a project write; a project zone whose project root cannot resolve fails
CLOSED (FenceError), never widening to the bin. Under a self-hosted / legacy
layout (HARNESS_BIN_ROOT unset, bin == project) the caller's explicit `root` is
honored exactly as before, preserving every existing caller and test.

Honesty caveat (carried from the source corpus, mirrors the helper's real
reach): this is a SCRIPT-path guard ONLY. It raises before a script write
lands outside its zone. It CANNOT stop a raw LLM `Write`, nor an LLM composing
a body directly to disk — those are governed by the prose contract + the
review/CI invariants, not by this assert. It is the harness disciplining its
own scripts, nothing more.

A missing or malformed ownership.yaml fails LOUD at import time: a guard that
silently degrades to "allow everything" protects nothing. Compliance hooks
importing this module turn that ImportError-time crash into exit 2 + guidance
via their fail-closed wrapper.
