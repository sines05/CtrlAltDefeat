"""
check_fence — advisory soft-fence SCAN. Reports working-tree changes that land
OUTSIDE the declared ownership zones. ADVISORY ONLY: it never blocks, always
exits 0, and is not a write guard.

This is the pull-side companion to `fs_guard` (the script-path containment
helper). Where `fs_guard` refuses an out-of-zone SCRIPT write, this scan
surfaces — after the fact — any file the session touched outside the owned
zones (including raw LLM `Write`s and LLM-composed bodies the helper cannot
intercept). It feeds the memory-gap pass as a soft nudge, not a gate.

Fence boundary is DATA-DRIVEN: the in-fence prefixes are the union of every
zone root declared in ownership.yaml (the same table fs_guard reads), not a
hard-coded directory. Adding a zone is a config edit. The harness scans its own
working tree, so the zones it owns (docs/, harness/state/, harness/standards/,
plans/) are in-fence and everything else is a breach finding.

Mechanism: `git status --porcelain` over the project root lists every changed
path; any path not under a declared zone is one `fence_breach` finding
(severity `warn`). No LLM, deterministic. If `root` is not inside a git work
tree, the scan degrades to empty findings (it cannot read change state, and
advisory is not an error). Flood-control (capping a large breach set) lives one
layer up in the memory-gap collector, not here — this scan reports faithfully.
