"""lens_docs_build.py — docs-build outcome lens (read-only).

Reads the fine-grained build-outcome sink (`docs-build.jsonl`) that the docs-build
orchestrator emits at end-of-run: how many showcase builds ran in the window, how
many failed (and at which stage), and the latest published page/diagram counts. The
generic skill-invocation lens already counts THAT `/hs:docs-build` was called; this
lens reads what each build actually DID. Pure gather → render-agnostic dict. READ-ONLY.

Fail-soft on telemetry (bad lines skipped). An absent sink renders as "no builds in
the window", never an error.
