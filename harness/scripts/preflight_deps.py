"""preflight_deps.py — check that external deps the harness needs are importable.

Policy: external deps are allowed but CONTROLLED — this script is the
single registry. Run it once per machine after clone (and in CI before tests).
Missing deps: prints the exact install command and exits non-zero.

Posture downstream when someone skips this step:
  - compliance hooks fail CLOSED (exit 2 + the same install command),
  - telemetry/nudge hooks skip silently.

Usage:
    python3 harness/scripts/preflight_deps.py            # human report
    python3 harness/scripts/preflight_deps.py --quiet    # exit code only (hooks/CI)
