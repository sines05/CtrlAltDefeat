"""transcript_questions.py — find the most-recent still-open AskUserQuestion in a
Claude Code session transcript.

A compaction summary keeps the conversation's gist but can flatten a question the
user was still weighing into a settled decision. The fix needs no model-written
marker: CC already records every turn to a jsonl transcript. This helper reverse-
scans the transcript tail for the LAST AskUserQuestion (AUQ) tool_use and decides
whether it is still open:

  - no answer recorded (AUQ was the last thing before compaction) -> unanswered
  - answered with text that matches an offered option label       -> clean (skip)
  - answered with free text that matches no label (a redirect)    -> free_text

Only the most-recent AUQ matters — earlier questions are trusted as settled. The
read is bounded to the last 256 KiB (mirrors emit_session_summary / reinject_stop_
context); the answer is almost never the last line (hooks + assistant turns fire
after it, before compaction), hence the reverse scan rather than a tail-line peek.

Transcript shape pinned from real transcripts on CC v2.1.195 (see the module test
for the exact records). This format is CC-internal and version-fragile — "scripts
parsing these can break on any release" — so EVERY path fails open: a missing
file, a torn line, an unfamiliar shape, or any exception yields None. The caller
(pending_decisions_resurface) treats None as "stay silent", so shape drift in a
future CC release degrades to today's behavior, never to a crash.
