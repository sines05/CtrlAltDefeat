"""check_skill_structure.py — structural + content lint for hs:* skills.

Enforces the thin-core discipline the harness documents for skills: a SKILL.md stays
small so the always-loaded core is cheap, and detail is pushed one level deep into
references/ that themselves stay bounded. Three existing validators cover other
concerns (catalog.tier_problems for compliance-tier; the dot-claude tree for
frontmatter/cross-refs) — this one owns the size + description-shape gap none of them
check, plus the WRITE-time content integrity the skill_quality_gate hook enforces.

Size is measured in CHARS, not lines — line-count is a bad proxy that rewards narrow
wrapping and lets a wide-wrapped file smuggle 2-3x the content past the same cap.

Findings by severity:
  - HARD: an over-budget SKILL.md body / reference / agent (skill-md-too-large /
    reference-too-large / agent-too-large), a run-on line past the per-line cap
    (overlong-line), a dangling local reference the body points at
    (broken-reference-link), and a machine birth-marker leaking into prose
    (birth-marker-leak).
  - ADVISORY: description shape, an orphan reference no body links (orphan-reference),
    and tight email / US-SSN PII shapes (pii-possible).

Contract (mirrors check_report_language):
  - Advisory by default: exits 0, emits a per-skill verdict on stdout, never mutates.
  - With --strict any HARD finding exits non-zero. CI runs --strict only on skills
    CHANGED vs main, so existing skills are grandfathered until they are next touched.
  - write_gate_reason() is the compliance-core for the PostToolUse skill_quality_gate
    hook: it blocks ONLY on the HARD content rules (dangling reference / birth-marker),
    leaving size to CI and shape/PII advisory.

Input is a skill directory (one with a SKILL.md) or a root that holds skill dirs;
a root is swept. A path with no SKILL.md is inert (skipped, exit 0).
