"""artifact_stamp.py — stamp harness provenance into a markdown artifact.

A plan/report carries a YAML frontmatter stamp so its origin travels WITH the
file: copied anywhere, even away from the harness, it still says which harness
version (and exact tree fingerprint) produced it. The stamp is deliberately
deterministic — version + kit_digest + schema_version, NO wall-clock — so the
PostToolUse hook that calls it can re-fire on every write and reach a fixed
point: stamping the same text twice is byte-identical.

stamp_markdown is a pure text transform (no YAML dependency, no I/O): it merges
the harness_* keys into an existing frontmatter block or prepends one, never
touching other keys or the body/evidence. The CLI stamps files in place using
the live release identity (harness_release.read_release).
