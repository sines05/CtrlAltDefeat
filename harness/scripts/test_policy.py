"""test_policy.py — two-tier Definition-of-Done policy loader/merger.

Tier-1 (`harness/data/test-policy.yaml`, env override HARNESS_TEST_POLICY) is
the shipped default — the SPINE: a missing/malformed tier-1 raises (a gate with
no policy must never default-to-pass). Tier-2 (`<repo-root>/test-policy.yaml`,
which lives OUTSIDE harness/** by construction) is the repo override.

Merge contract (KISS — union + strictness-aware override, no deep inheritance):
  - a change-class present ONLY in tier-2 is ADDED (union).
  - for a class in BOTH, tier-2 wins WHEN it STRENGTHENS or matches the gate
    (raising enforcement, adding required types) — applied directly.
  - WEAKENING the gate (enforcement hard→soft, dropping a tier-1 required type,
    lowering a numeric coverage line) is refused unless the tier-2 class carries
    `grace: { reason: <non-empty> }`. An honored grace is applied AND emits a
    `policy_grace` audit trace — the backdoor is git-visible, never silent.
  - a MAJOR schema_version mismatch between the tiers raises (fail-loud, mirrors
    artifact_check.load_policy).
  - tier-2 absent → a clean copy of tier-1, no raise.

Posture: this is a DECLARATIVE policy reader, not an authenticator. It says what
the gate must demand; WHO ran the tests is attribution elsewhere.
