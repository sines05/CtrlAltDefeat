"""skill_selection.py — install-time per-skill selection for the single hs plugin.

After the collapse every skill lives under harness/plugins/hs/skills and the only
plugin is `hs` (always on), so a per-plugin toggle no longer selects skills. An
install instead picks skills at the dir level:

  - a GROUP expands to its skills (components.yaml `skills:` list),
  - a manually-picked skill AUTO-TICKS its declared deps (skill-deps.yaml),
  - the 16-skill spine floor is ALWAYS present (never omittable),
  - deselected skills are OMITTED at copy.

Dir-omission is the only disable that works for plugin skills on this CC version
(the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter is unsupported for plugin
skills — see the probe). The omit list drives the verify_install seam and
the hs-cli re-enable path.
