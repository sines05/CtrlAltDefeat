"""register_store — shared primitives for append-only fenced-record registers
(the Decision Register `DEC-<n>` today; any future register reuses this).

One ruling per `---`-fenced YAML block. This module is the single home for the
structural machinery — the block-splitter regex, the record-fence/heading
injection escape, the best-effort file lock, and the raw id scan — so a fix
lands once. Register modules keep only their own specifics (field schema,
render template, alloc/append flow).

Lock posture: POSIX uses fcntl.flock. On platforms without it (or when flock
refuses) the lock degrades to a no-op BUT warns once per process: multiple
agents appending the same register concurrently on this machine can overwrite
each other's records. The warning informs — it never blocks the write; one
clone per developer (the deployment model) makes the race rare, and the
notebook files are typically written by the main agent at task end.
