"""path_glob.py — the canonical path-glob matcher shared by the harness gates.

Before this, the component-policy gate (artifact_check._matching_components) and
the RBAC-lane gate (agent_permissions._matches) each rolled their own fnmatch
loop with subtly different rules, so the SAME pattern could match in one gate and
not the other. This is the single place that decides "does this path match this
glob", so a pattern author predicts one behavior everywhere.

Semantics — fnmatch (`*` spans `/`), case-sensitive, with two conveniences:
  - a leading `**/` is ALSO tried stripped, so `**/auth/**` matches a top-level
    `auth/x` as well as a nested `src/auth/x` (fnmatch gives `**` no special
    meaning, so without this `**/auth/**` would miss the top-level case);
  - the pattern is ALSO tried against the path's basename, so a file glob like
    `*.tf` or `config.yaml` matches at any depth.
Both conveniences are no-ops for a multi-segment directory glob (e.g.
`harness/**`), so existing lane/component patterns keep their behavior.
