"""artifact_check.py — artifact presence gate + active-plan resolution.

check_stage(stage, root) returns None (pass) or a BLOCK REASON string — the
core contract run_compliance_hook expects, so the gate hook stays a thin
shell around this module.

Policy is data-driven from harness/data/stage-policy.yaml (override:
HARNESS_STAGE_POLICY env). A missing/malformed policy raises — the compliance
wrapper turns that into exit 2 + guidance (a gate without its policy must not
silently pass).

HONESTY: this is a PRESENCE gate. It proves the step RAN — the
artifact exists, parses, and carries the required fields — it does NOT verify
WHO ran it. Actor fields are attribution, never authorization. The
plan-approval kind is personal-first SLIM: no roster, no quorum, no role rule.
It validates verdict (APPROVED), plan-binding, and a normalized plan-dir hash.
Self-approval is deliberate anti-drift discipline, not an anti-fraud check; it
still does not authenticate anyone — actor strings stay spoofable by design.

Artifacts (machine-written, pure-YAML preferred, legacy JSON read too) live at:
    plans/<active-plan>/artifacts/<kind>.yaml  (or legacy <kind>.json)
Active plan resolution: HARNESS_ACTIVE_PLAN env (path or bare dir name under
plans/) > newest plans/*/plan.md with `status: in_progress` frontmatter.
