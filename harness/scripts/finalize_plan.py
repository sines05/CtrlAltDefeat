"""finalize_plan.py — deterministically move a plan to `completed`, but ONLY on
derived evidence: all N phases carry a PASS snapshot AND the canonical
verification belongs to this plan.

This is the one primitive allowed to take a plan out of the pending/approved
"trap": close_plan deliberately finalizes only from in_progress (a misaimed
manual close must never mark unstarted work done), so an auto-opened plan that
was never hand-opened could otherwise never close. finalize_plan threads the
open->close itself, gated so it cannot fire early:

  1. containment — outside plans/ is an error (reuses plan_status discipline).
  2. evidence gate — derive_plan_completion.is_complete is the ONLY "done"
     signal. A single verification verdict is NOT trusted (the early-close
     trap): one PASS can never satisfy N distinct node-phases.
  3. cross-plan binding — a canonical verification whose `plan` names a DIFFERENT
     dir is a copied/forged artifact; no-op rather than close the wrong plan.
  4. status — completed/cancelled left alone; pending/approved opened first;
     in_progress closed directly.

Never raises: any unexpected error degrades to a benign no-op Result. A status
flip emits a trace event (plan_auto_finalize) and the caller surfaces one line.
