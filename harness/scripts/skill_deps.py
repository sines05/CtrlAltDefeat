"""Loader and resolver for the skill dependency graph.

The installer's skill picker uses this graph: when a user ticks a skill, its
declared dependencies are auto-ticked transitively, and a fixed core-immutable
spine can never be unticked. The graph lives in `harness/data/skill-deps.yaml`.

Shape of the data file::

    core_immutable: [plan, cook, test, ...]   # the 13 spine skills
    skills:
      cook: { deps: [plan, test] }
      scout: { deps: [] }
      ...

Every skill listed under `skills:` is one of the project's skills, and every
name appearing in any `deps:` list must itself be a declared skill key. The
loader enforces both invariants and raises ValueError naming the offender.
