"""voice_prefs.py — resolve the terminal-voice knobs from terminal-voice.yaml.

The terminal voice is the harness's CONVERSATIONAL register in the terminal —
how the assistant talks to the user while working — NOT the language or candor
of any written artifact. Knobs:

  terminal_voice_level   0..5   explanation depth/format of terminal answers (5 = full)
  persona        none + 13 catalog ids   the surface FORM of terminal prose
                       (the full catalog of ids; `none` is the default)
  voice_level    1..9   harshness/bluntness register on the terminal (5 = blunt,
                       no profanity; 6-9 escalate). The universal-harm floor and
                       the scope-fence are enforced in harness/rules/terminal-voice.md,
                       NOT here — this module stores closed-enum values, judges nothing.
  no_markdown    bool   drop markdown formatting from terminal answers

SCOPE-FENCE: these knobs shape terminal SURFACE prose only. They never alter
code, generated docs/reports, commits, evidence, or any gate decision; and they
do NOT control an artifact's own designed voice (the journal-writer's brutal
candor, the hs:critique neutral tone). See harness/rules/terminal-voice.md.

Tolerance ported from product-spec preferences.py: a missing file, missing key,
out-of-range enum, wrong-typed value, or corrupt YAML all resolve to the default
and load() NEVER raises. The write path (save) validates the closed enums and
raises VoicePrefsError so the on-disk file stays canonical for the next read.

Loader idiom mirrors guard_policy: resolve off __file__, honor an env override
HARNESS_TERMINAL_VOICE so tests/ephemeral runs point at a scratch file; the
committed default lives next to the data dir.
