"""plan_status.py — surgical, idempotent plan.md frontmatter status flips.

Shared core for the two lifecycle endpoints that move a plan through the only
two states the gate actually consumes:

  open_plan:  pending | approved -> in_progress   (cook's first step)
  close_plan: in_progress        -> completed     (cook's finalize step)

Discipline (mirrored from both callers' original behaviour):
  - Status is read/written ONLY inside the opening `---` … closing `---`/`...`
    block, never from the body — a plan body may quote `status: ...` in prose.
  - Only the status VALUE is rewritten; every other byte is preserved.
  - Idempotent: a plan already at the target status is a successful no-op.
  - Containment: refuses any plan dir outside <root>/plans/, so a misaimed path
    cannot rewrite an unrelated file's frontmatter.

`error_on_other` is the open/close asymmetry. close leaves an off-source status
(e.g. pending) alone as a benign no-op — a misaimed close must never mark
unstarted work done. open instead fails LOUD on an off-source status (e.g.
completed/cancelled): if it cannot reach in_progress, cook must halt rather than
cook a plan the resolver will never see as active.
