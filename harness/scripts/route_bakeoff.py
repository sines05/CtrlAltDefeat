"""route_bakeoff.py — probe-set structural validator for hs:* skill routing.

The hs:* skill ``description`` strings are the router contract: the text the
UserPromptSubmit / SessionStart surface and ``hs:find-skills``
match a user's intent against. Nothing tests them today — ``check_skill_structure``
only lints shape. This turns them into a cheap regression surface.

HONEST framing (the $0 pass does NOT measure routing): ``score_structural`` fires no
router and scores no over/under-trigger. It parses every ``description`` into a
catalog and checks a human-edited probe-set is internally consistent against it —
every probe targets a skill that exists (or the ``__none__`` sentinel), every
``none`` probe is shaped as one, and no distractor doubles as a probe target. Its CI
value is catching a probe YAML that went stale (target renamed/removed) or
self-contradicts — NOT proving routing works. A green CI check must not be read as
"routing tested".

Real routing rates require firing the router prompt and only run under ``--run-llm``
(opt-in, needs a runner — outside CI). The three axes are reported SEPARATELY so
over-trigger (``none_clean_rate``) is never folded into under-trigger
(``indirect_rate`` / ``context_only_rate``).

Contract (mirrors check_report_language / check_skill_structure):
  - Advisory by default: exits 0, prints a JSON verdict, never mutates.
  - ``--strict`` exits non-zero on a FAIL verdict (a structural config contradiction,
    or — under ``--run-llm`` — a measured rate below its threshold).
  - ``--run-llm`` fires the router to score the 3 rates; without a runner it skips
    clean (exit 0, named), mirroring check_report_language's degrade path.
  - No probe-set at the resolved path => skip clean (exit 0, named).
