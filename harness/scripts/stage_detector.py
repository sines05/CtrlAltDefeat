"""stage_detector.py — map a Bash command to the SDLC stage it advances.

detect_stage(command) returns one of push|commit|pr|ship|deploy, or None.
Patterns are BOUNDARY-STRICT: they only match where a command can
actually start — string start or right after `;`, `&`, `|`, `(`, or a
newline. So `echo "git push"` (the string is an argument) and `git pushing`
(word boundary) do NOT match.

Wrapper reach (hardening): a wrapper AT a command head is unwrapped and
recursed — `sh -c 'git push'`, `bash -c "..."`, `eval '...'` — and a
path-qualified binary (`/usr/bin/git`, `./gh`) is still that binary. A wrapper
name INSIDE a quoted argument is NOT unwrapped (boundary rule), and obfuscation
the unwrap cannot reach (unquoted eval args, `$var` indirection, base64) stays
the floor. The git pre-push hook still covers the push stage at the transport
level regardless of how the push command was spelled. guess_stage() additionally
samples a NARROW set of free-floating words — only the ship/deploy class
(release / publish / ship / deploy*, see _GUESS_PATTERNS) — as advisory trace
(never a gate signal). push/commit/pr words are deliberately NOT sampled: they
are far too common in ordinary prose to be signal, so a wrapper-hidden
`sh -c 'git push'` stays invisible to this guess channel and is covered ONLY by
the transport-level pre-push hook, not by the trace sample.
