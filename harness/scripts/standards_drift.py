standards_drift — deterministic "code moved but the auto-loaded prose standards
didn't" detector.

SCRIPT-only, pure judgment. `hs:plan` / `hs:cook` READ two prose standards into
context before working: docs/system-architecture.md + docs/code-standards.md (plus
the full reference docs/harness/system-architecture.md). When a session edits
architecture/standards-bearing CODE under harness/ but touches none of those docs,
the context those skills load risks drifting from reality — a high-signal, cheap
thing to flag.

This is the event-triggered twin of decision_capture: it has a concrete trigger
(the session's edited paths), so it judges on what THIS session wrote rather than
the whole working tree. No git read, no LLM judgment — the pure `assess` is the
whole detector and is unit-tested without a repo. ALWAYS degrades to None on empty
or non-arch input (advisory is not an error).

Signal (or None):
    {"type": "standards_drift", "subjects": [<paths>], "total": <int>}

CLI (debug):
    standards_drift.py path [path ...]   # emit {"signal": {...}|null}, exit 0
