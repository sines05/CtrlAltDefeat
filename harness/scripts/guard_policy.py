"""guard_policy.py — one off/warn/block posture for every configurable guard.

The harness ships many gates: host-safety, secret-read, stage presence, file
ownership, protected-branch refusal, advisory nudges. Before this module each
gate decided "block or not" its own way (compliance hooks had a 3-state via
harness-hooks.yaml; CLI gates had none). That made posture impossible to tune
from one place and impossible to scale beginner -> power user.

This module is that one place. A guard resolves its mode from:
  1. an explicit per-guard `overrides:` entry, if present, ELSE
  2. the active `preset` (strict | balanced | lenient | solo) applied to the guard's
     CATEGORY (safety | enforcement | advisory), THEN
  3. a safety FLOOR clamp: a guard whose floor is `block` can never be lowered
     by a preset. Only an explicit override lowers it — that write is a
     break-glass, recorded separately by guard_config (see is_floor_breach).

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE (always-on correctness invariants — making any
of these warn/off would corrupt state, so they are NOT registered and have no
off/warn/block knob): input-validation grammars (claims task-id,
decision_register id), path containment (fs_guard.assert_under), every config
loader's own validation, plan_approval's role-consistency of a written
artifact, and the CI bug-class invariants. Posture tunes ENFORCEMENT, never
correctness.

Loader idiom: resolve off __file__, typed error, lazy yaml. This gate DOES
honor an env override
(HARNESS_GUARD_POLICY) so tests and ephemeral runs can point at a scratch file;
the committed default still lives next to the data dir.
