"""user_override.py — the per-repo (layer-b) operational-rule override layer.

A repo tunes the operational rules with override files: either a folder of
`*.yaml` (default `docs/standards/`, set by `harness/data/standards.yaml
user_rules_dir`) whose `overrides:` lists are merged, or the legacy single
`<repo>/standards.user.yaml` used as a fallback when the folder is empty. The
env var `HARNESS_USER_OVERRIDE` (a file OR a dir) overrides both. Every override
is LOUD (it surfaces a warning) and MUST carry a non-empty `reason:` — silent or
unexplained overrides are refused.

Precedence floor — a floor rule is an inviolable safety layer:
  - an override BY ID targeting a floor rule is refused (the rule is unchanged),
    whether that floor is in the base set or was declared by an earlier override
    in the same pass (the live by-id view is checked);
  - a NEW-id user rule whose scope overlaps a BASE (shipped) floor with a WEAKER
    posture (lower severity, or disabled) is refused too — you cannot dodge a
    shipped floor by adding a fresh id. This new-id-shadow refusal applies ONLY
    to base floors: a repo's own layer-b rules coexist with its own declared
    floor (same author, not a dodge), so a broad-scoped self-floor does not
    refuse the repo's other rules on overlapping scopes.
An override may itself declare `floor: true` to make a repo-local rule
inviolable. Floor is also enforced at the coverage gate — defense in depth.

Conflict-detect (advisory in 2.2): a user rule whose scope overlaps a non-floor
std rule with an opposite severity is flagged. Disjoint scopes never warn (uses
the P0 glob-intersection predicate, not a substring guess).

Format:
    overrides:
      - rule_id: STD-...     # an existing rule (modify) or a new id (add)
        reason: "..."        # REQUIRED, non-empty
        severity: info       # optional fields to set
        enabled: false
        scope: ["**/*.py"]

API:
    load(repo_root) -> [override dict, ...]
    apply(rules, overrides) -> (new_rules, warnings)
    detect_conflicts(user_rules, std_rules) -> [finding, ...]
