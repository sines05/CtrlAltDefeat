"""register_block.py — SSOT builder for the resolved-register context block.

Both context hooks — voice_inject (SessionStart) and subagent_init (SubagentStart)
— call build_register so the two surfaces cannot drift. The block carries the
terminal-voice axes, the universal-harm floor, the scope-fence, the persona line,
the interview knobs, and the audience / code_style register knobs — the one-line
essence + a MANDATORY directive to READ the profile file before writing the first
deliverable (diet C: the full MANDATORY/FORBIDDEN body is no longer dumped every
turn — body_for stays public for any skill that needs to slice it on demand).

Pure library, never raises: body_for reads a profile file inside try/except and
degrades to "" on any failure — it never blocks a session or a subagent (the callers
are telemetry-class, fail-open).
