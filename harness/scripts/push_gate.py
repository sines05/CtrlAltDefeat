"""push_gate.py — transport-level routing for `git push`.

The git pre-push hook feeds ref updates on stdin, one line per ref:

    <local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>

push_gate reads the destination branch names (the 3rd field), and picks the
stage to enforce: a push to a PROTECTED branch is a `merge` (it must clear the
same merge-grade artifacts a reviewed PR would), every other push is `push`.
Empty stdin (no ref lines) → `push`, preserving the legacy hook's behavior.

check() routes the merge-stage reason through the merge_gate FLOOR guard so the
decision is audited and can be lowered ONLY by a logged break-glass override in
guard-policy.yaml — never by a preset.
