"""disabled_skills.py — state library for install-disabled (omitted) skills.

After the 2.0.0 plugin collapse a fresh install can OMIT a skill at the dir level
(the only disable that works for plugin skills): the dir is stashed under
harness/plugins/hs/disabled-skills/ — a TRACKED sibling of skills/ that ships with
the bundle yet the loader never scans — and recorded in install-omitted-skills.json.
The omit record stays under harness/state/ (per-install hint); the stash's presence
is the ship-with-bundle signal. This module is the single reader that turns those
raw records + stash dirs into the
questions the off-skill machinery asks:

  * effective_disabled(sources) — which skills are off, unioned across sources.
  * status(skill, sources)      — live | disabled | unknown.
  * dep_chain(skill, sources, deps_path) — the DISABLED dep-closure of a skill, in
    load (discovery) order, so hs:use can pull a whole tail of off deps before it
    reads a disabled target.
  * describe / skill_list        — the human label (from the stashed SKILL.md), with
    a stash_missing flag for a recorded-but-never-copied (install-omitted) skill.
  * stash_path                   — the abs path of the stashed dir (the read-inline
    route the router points a caller at).

Multi-source is deliberate and load-bearing: the API takes an explicit
``sources: list[Paths]`` so a later phase can append a cache source WITHOUT changing
the resolver — every query simply unions/overlays the extra source. Each Paths bundle
is one location (its live skills dir, its stash dir, its omit record). Reads are
fail-soft: an absent dir or unparseable record contributes nothing rather than raising.
