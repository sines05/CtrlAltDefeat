"""lens_workflow_chains.py — actual per-session skill chains (telemetry
invocations.jsonl) vs the chains DECLARED in harness/data/skill-chains.yaml;
ranks common chains + flags deviations. PORT PS near-verbatim; env knob is
HARNESS_SKILL_CHAINS, sinks resolve through telemetry_paths.

The declared side reads an on-demand data file owned by the harness (not
always-on context); it fails LOUD when that file is missing or malformed —
a packaging/authoring bug must never read as "zero declared chains". The
actual side is fail-soft on telemetry data (bad lines skipped).

Pure gather → render-agnostic dict. READ-ONLY.
