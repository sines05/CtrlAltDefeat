"""verification_snapshot.py — shared per-phase snapshot + plan-lifecycle core.

A plan's canonical verification.{json,yaml} is OVERWRITTEN every phase (it is the
current-phase verdict the gate reads O(1)). That makes it useless for "are all N
phases done?" — only the last phase's verdict survives. So completion is DERIVED,
not asserted: when a verification carrying verdict PASS + a phase id is written,
copy it once to verification-<phase>.json (first-wins, never overwriting).

This module is the SINGLE home of that logic so the two write paths share it
byte-for-byte: the PostToolUse hook (phase_progress_writer.py) for verifications
written through the Write tool, and write_verification.py for verifications
written from Bash — which never trips PostToolUse and so must call this directly.
Keeping one module is why direction B beats a script-only fix: hook and script
provably cannot drift.

Telemetry-grade helpers: snapshot/lifecycle degrade to no-op on bad input, never
raise. Path resolution is off __file__ (PS discipline), never CWD.
